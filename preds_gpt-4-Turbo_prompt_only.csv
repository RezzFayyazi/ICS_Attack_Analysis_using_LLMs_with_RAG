"ICS tactic(s): Inhibit Response Function, Impair Process Control

Explanation:
- Inhibit Response Function: By opening the two additional COM ports, Industroyer ensures that no other processes can access them, which could inhibit the ability of operators or automated systems to respond to issues or receive accurate data from the RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) device.
- Impair Process Control: The IEC 101 payload component taking over control of the RTU device directly impacts the ability to manage the process being controlled by that device, thus impairing the normal process control functions."
"ICS tactic(s): Inhibit Response Function, Impair Process Control

Explanation:
- Inhibit Response Function: By switching the state of IOAs, the Industroyer IEC 104 module can inhibit the ability of operators to respond to real-time conditions or alerts, as it can manipulate the control commands and possibly create a state of confusion or misrepresentation of the actual process being monitored or controlled.

- Impair Process Control: The module's ability to send select and execute packets to change the state of IOAs and continuously loop to switch the state of all discovered IOAs can directly impair the process control functions of the ICS environment. This could lead to incorrect actions being taken by the control system, potentially causing disruption, damage, or unsafe conditions."

This falls under the Execution tactic as it involves the running of code to achieve their objectives within the ICS environment.

- Command and Control: The use of a command line parameter to specify the payload suggests that the adversary had a level of control over the system to dynamically instruct it on which payload to execute. This indicates the presence of a Command and Control (C2) mechanism that allows attackers to maintain communication with the compromised system and potentially issue commands remotely."
"ICS tactic(s): Execution, Command and Control

Explanation:
- Execution: The Industroyer payload DLL being executed via a command line parameter indicates that the adversary is using a technique to run their own code on the targeted Industrial Control System (ICS) environment. This falls under the Execution tactic, which involves the running of malicious code to achieve their objectives within the ICS environment.

- Command and Control: The payload DLL is supplied by the attackers through one of the main backdoors, which implies that the attackers have established a means to communicate with the compromised system and can send commands to it. This is indicative of the Command and Control tactic, where adversaries maintain communication with compromised systems to control them remotely, often including the delivery and execution of payloads."

"ICS tactic(s): Inhibit Response Function, Impair Process Control"
"ICS tactic(s): Impair Process Control, Inhibit Response Function

Explanation:
Bad Rabbit is a type of ransomware that encrypts files on a computer, demanding payment to restore access to the data. In the context of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), the encryption of files could directly impair process control by making necessary software, configuration files, or operational data inaccessible to the control systems. This would prevent operators from effectively managing the processes that the ICS controls.

Additionally, by encrypting files on computers within transportation organizations, the ransomware could inhibit response functions. This is because the tools and data that operators and incident responders would typically use to diagnose and respond to issues within the ICS environment would be unavailable due to the encryption. This can delay or prevent the restoration of safe and reliable operations, potentially leading to extended downtime and increased risk to the organization and its stakeholders."
"ICS tactic(s): Impair Process Control, Inhibit Response Function"
"ICS tactic(s): Impair Process Control, Inhibit Response Function

Explanation:
EKANS, also known as Snake, is a type of ransomware that targets industrial control systems (ICS). When EKANS infects an ICS environment, it can encrypt files and potentially disrupt processes by making certain files and applications inaccessible. This directly impacts the ability to control processes within the environment.

The MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework outlines various tactics that describe the goals of adversaries. In the case of EKANS infection at a Honda manufacturing plant, the following tactics are relevant:

1. Impair Process Control (Tactics ID: TA4): This tactic involves hindering the control of physical processes in an ICS environment. EKANS can achieve this by encrypting files that are necessary for the operation of control systems, thereby preventing operators from effectively managing the industrial processes.

2. Inhibit Response Function (Tactics ID: TA5): This tactic includes actions that prevent the normal response to incidents, faults, or other conditions. By deploying ransomware like EKANS, adversaries can inhibit the ability of operators to diagnose and respond to issues, as critical software and data needed for response may be encrypted and held for ransom.

It's important to note that while these tactics describe the adversary's goals, the specific techniques used to achieve these goals can vary. In the case of EKANS, techniques could include the use of ransomware, data encryption, and potentially the disruption of network communications if the malware has capabilities to spread or affect network devices."

"ICS tactic(s): Impair Process Control, Spoofing I/O Images"
"ICS Tactic(s): Impair Process Control, Inhibit Response Function, Evasion

Explanation:

- Impair Process Control: By injecting malicious code into the PLC, Stuxnet is able to manipulate the industrial process being controlled by the PLC. This directly impacts the ability of the control system to operate as intended.

- Inhibit Response Function: Stuxnet's ability to hide its presence and intercept read/write requests can prevent operators or automated systems from recognizing that the PLC has been compromised. This inhibits the normal response function of the control system, as it may not trigger alarms or allow for proper diagnostics.

- Evasion: The rootkit component of Stuxnet is designed to evade detection by modifying requests to hide its presence. This allows the malware to persist on the infected device and continue its operations without being discovered by security measures in place."

"ICS tactic(s): Execution, Inhibit Response Function, Impair Process Control

Explanation:

- Execution: The Triton malware executes its malicious payload by using a Python environment embedded within a Windows executable (trilog.exe). This allows the malware to run its code on the targeted industrial control system (ICS) environment.

- Inhibit Response Function: Triton is known for its capability to manipulate safety instrumented systems (SIS). By communicating with Triconex controllers, it can potentially modify or inhibit the safety functions that are designed to shut down a process when unsafe conditions are detected. This could prevent the system from responding to hazardous events, putting the facility at risk.

- Impair Process Control: By interacting with the Triconex controllers, Triton can potentially alter the logic or parameters that control the industrial process. This could lead to the disruption of normal operations and potentially cause physical damage or unsafe conditions."

"ICS tactic(s): Command and Control, Inhibit Response Function, Impair Process Control

Explanation:
- Command and Control: The ability to remotely send commands to a malicious agent indicates that the adversary has established a means of controlling the compromised system, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
- Inhibit Response Function: By sending commands to the PLC, the adversary could potentially inhibit safety mechanisms or alerts, thereby impacting the ability to respond to the attack or system malfunction.
- Impair Process Control: Since the adversary is able to send commands to the PLC, they could manipulate the process being controlled by the PLC, leading to the impairment of normal operations."
"ICS tactic(s): Command and Control

Explanation: In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) framework, the tactic that describes an adversary's ability to communicate with systems under their control within a victim's network is ""Command and Control."" The use of HTTP requests for communication with a command and control (C2) server is a technique that falls under this tactic. It involves the adversary establishing a means to communicate with the compromised system to control it, issue commands, and exfiltrate data."
"ICS tactic(s): Command and Control

Explanation: In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) framework, the described procedure of REvil ransomware using HTTPS POST messages with randomly generated URLs to communicate with a remote server is indicative of the ""Command and Control"" tactic. This tactic involves techniques that enable adversaries to communicate with systems under their control within a victim's network. The use of HTTPS POST messages for communication is a common method for establishing command and control channels, as it allows the malware to send commands to compromised systems and exfiltrate data while attempting to blend in with normal network traffic and evade detection."
"ICS Tactic(s): Inhibit Response Function, Impair Process Control

Explanation:
- Inhibit Response Function: By constantly monitoring and potentially modifying the data within block DB890, Stuxnet can manipulate the normal operation of the PLC. This could prevent operators from seeing accurate data or receiving alerts, thus inhibiting the system's ability to respond to issues.

- Impair Process Control: Stuxnet's ability to read and write to block DB890 allows it to alter the behavior of sequences A and B. This directly impacts the control logic of the PLC, potentially leading to incorrect operations, sabotage, or unsafe conditions within the industrial process it controls."

Without specific details on the procedures used by TEMP.Veles, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact MITRE ATT&CK for ICS tactics they would achieve. However, based on the general knowledge of cyberattacks against Industrial Control Systems (ICS) vendors and manufacturers, we can infer several tactics that might be relevant:

1. Initial Access: Tactics to gain entry into the ICS environment, such as exploiting public-facing applications or using spear-phishing to compromise vendor credentials.
2. Execution: Tactics that involve the running of malicious code within the ICS environment after initial access has been gained.
3. Persistence: Tactics to maintain a foothold within the ICS environment, such as manipulating device startup scripts or configurations.
4. Evasion: Tactics to avoid detection, such as disabling security software or altering logs.
5. Discovery: Tactics to understand the ICS environment, such as scanning for control system devices or querying system information.
6. Lateral Movement: Tactics to move through the ICS environment, such as using legitimate credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities in the ICS network.
7. Collection: Tactics to gather data of interest, such as capturing network traffic or acquiring files with sensitive information.
8. Command and Control: Tactics to communicate with compromised systems to control them remotely, often involving non-standard protocols or encrypted channels.
9. Impact: Tactics to disrupt, damage, or destroy systems and processes, such as manipulating control logic or causing a denial of service.

These tactics are part of the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework, which outlines the common behaviors adversaries may use against ICS systems. The specific tactics used by TEMP.Veles would depend on the details of their attack procedures."
