For example, devices such as protection relays may have an operation mode designed for firmware installation. This mode may halt process monitoring and related functions to allow new firmware to be loaded. A device left in update mode may be placed in an inactive holding state if no firmware is provided to it. By entering and leaving a device in this mode, the adversary may deny its usual functionalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0800\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Joe Slowik - Dragos\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nThe Industroyer SIPROTEC DoS module places the victim device into firmware update mode.

Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment. Some ICS devices are particularly sensitive to DoS events, and may become unresponsive in reaction to even a simple ping sweep. Adversaries may also attempt to execute a Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) against certain devices, such as in the case of the BrickerBot malware. [1] Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to cause a denial of service by taking advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to cause a denial of service condition. Adversaries may have prior knowledge about industrial protocols or control devices used in the environment through Remote System Information Discovery. There are examples of adversaries remotely causing a Device Restart/Shutdown by exploiting a vulnerability that induces uncontrolled resource consumption.

Once this vulnerability is successfully exploited, the target device stops responding to any commands until it is rebooted manually. [6] Once the tool is executed it sends specifically crafted packets to port 50,000 of the target IP addresses using UDP. The UDP packet contains the following 18 byte payload: 0x11 49 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 28 9E.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

Adversaries could use these types of relationships to manage command and control communications, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion.

If a AiTM attack is established, then the adversary has the ability to block, log, modify, or inject traffic into the communication stream. There are several ways to accomplish this attack, but some of the most-common are Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning and the use of a proxy.

Alarm messages may be a part of an overall reporting system and of particular interest for adversaries. Disruption of the alarm system does not imply the disruption of the reporting system as a whole.A Secura presentation on targeting OT notes a dual fold goal for adversaries attempting alarm suppression: prevent outgoing alarms from being raised and prevent incoming alarms from being responded to. [1] The method of suppression may greatly depend on the type of alarm in question:  An alarm raised by a protocol message An alarm signaled with I/O An alarm bit set in a flag (and read) In ICS environments, the adversary may have to suppress or contend with multiple alarms and/or alarm propagation to achieve a specific goal to evade detection or prevent intended responses from occurring. [1]  Methods of suppression may involve tampering or altering device displays and logs, modifying in memory code to fixed values, or even tampering with assembly level instruction code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0878\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Jos Wetzels - Midnight Blue; Marina Krotofil\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0020 \n\n\n Maroochy Water Breach \n\n\nIn the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary suppressed alarm reporting to the central computer.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeted Assets\n\n\n\nID\nAsset\n\n\n\n\n\n A0007 \n\n\n Control Server \n\n\n\n\n A0009 \n\n\n Data Gateway \n\n\n\n\n A0006 \n\n\n Data Historian \n\n\n\n\n A0002 \n\n\n Human-Machine Interface (HMI) \n\n\n\n\n A0005 \n\n\n Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) \n\n\n\n\n A0003 \n\n\n Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) \n\n\n\n\n A0004 \n\n\n Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) \n\n\n\n\n A0010 \n\n\n Safety Controller \n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\n\n\nID\nMitigation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n M0807 \n\n\n Network Allowlists \n\n\nUtilize network allowlists to restrict unnecessary connections to network devices (e.g., comm servers, serial to ethernet converters) and services, especially in cases when devices have limits on the number of simultaneous sessions they support.\n\n\n\n\n M0930 \n\n\n Network Segmentation \n\n\nSegment operational assets and their management devices based on their functional role within the process.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases.

Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

Serial Communication ports (COM) allow communication with control system devices. Devices can receive command and configuration messages over such serial COM. Devices also use serial COM to send command and reporting messages. Blocking device serial COM may also block command messages and block reporting messages. A serial to Ethernet converter is often connected to a serial COM to facilitate communication between serial and Ethernet devices. One approach to blocking a serial COM would be to create and hold open a TCP session with the Ethernet side of the converter. A serial to Ethernet converter may have a few ports open to facilitate multiple communications. For example, if there are three serial COM available -- 1, 2 and 3 --, the converter might be listening on the corresponding ports 20001, 20002, and 20003. If a TCP/IP connection is opened with one of these ports and held open, then the port will be unavailable for use by another party. One way the adversary could achieve this would be to initiate a TCP session with the serial to Ethernet converter at 10.0.0.1 via Telnet on serial port 1 with the following command: telnet 10.0.0.1 20001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0805\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team overwrote the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware, rendering the devices not operational.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Serial Communication ports (COM) allow communication with control system devices. Devices can receive command and configuration messages over such serial COM. Devices also use serial COM to send command and reporting messages. Blocking device serial COM may also block command messages and block reporting messages. A serial to Ethernet converter is often connected to a serial COM to facilitate communication between serial and Ethernet devices. One approach to blocking a serial COM would be to create and hold open a TCP session with the Ethernet side of the converter. A serial to Ethernet converter may have a few ports open to facilitate multiple communications. For example, if there are three serial COM available -- 1, 2 and 3 --, the converter might be listening on the corresponding ports 20001, 20002, and 20003. If a TCP/IP connection is opened with one of these ports and held open, then the port will be unavailable for use by another party. One way the adversary could achieve this would be to initiate a TCP session with the serial to Ethernet converter at 10.0.0.1 via Telnet on serial port 1 with the following command: telnet 10.0.0.1 20001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0805\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team overwrote the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware, rendering the devices not operational.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals.

Serial Communication ports (COM) allow communication with control system devices. Devices can receive command and configuration messages over such serial COM. Devices also use serial COM to send command and reporting messages. Blocking device serial COM may also block command messages and block reporting messages. A serial to Ethernet converter is often connected to a serial COM to facilitate communication between serial and Ethernet devices. One approach to blocking a serial COM would be to create and hold open a TCP session with the Ethernet side of the converter. A serial to Ethernet converter may have a few ports open to facilitate multiple communications. For example, if there are three serial COM available -- 1, 2 and 3 --, the converter might be listening on the corresponding ports 20001, 20002, and 20003. If a TCP/IP connection is opened with one of these ports and held open, then the port will be unavailable for use by another party. One way the adversary could achieve this would be to initiate a TCP session with the serial to Ethernet converter at 10.0.0.1 via Telnet on serial port 1 with the following command: telnet 10.0.0.1 20001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0805\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team overwrote the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware, rendering the devices not operational.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites.

"Knowing this ICS attack procedure <<The Industroyer IEC 104 module has 3 modes available to perform its attack. These modes are range, shift, and sequence. The range mode operates in 2 stages. The first stage of range mode gathers Information Object Addresses (IOA) and sends select and execute packets to switch the state. The second stage of range mode has an infinite loop where it will switch the state of all of the previously discovered IOAs. Shift mode is similar to range mode, but instead of staying within the same range, it will add a shift value to the default range values. >>, what MITRE ATT&CK ICS tactics will a cyber adversary achieve with this technique?","ICS tactic(s): Execution, Impact","[Document(page_content=""Detect Operating Mode, Technique T0868 - ICS | MITRE ATT&CK®\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrices\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nTactics\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nTechniques\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nDefenses\n\n\nData Sources\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\nAssets\n\n\n\n\nCTI\n\n\nGroups\nSoftware\nCampaigns\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nGeneral Information\nGetting Started\nContribute\nTraining\nATT&CKcon\nWorking with ATT&CK\nFAQ\nUpdates\nVersions of ATT&CK\nRelated Projects\nBrand Guide\n\n\n\nBenefactors\n\n\n\nBlog\xa0\n        \n\n\n\nSearch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        ATT&CK v14 has been released!

Operating modes dictate what change or maintenance functions can be manipulated and are often controlled by a key switch on the PLC (e.g.,  run, prog [program], and remote). Knowledge of these states may be valuable to an adversary to determine if they are able to reprogram the PLC. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:  Program - This mode must be enabled before changes can be made to a devices program. This allows program uploads and downloads between the device and an engineering workstation. Often the PLCs logic Is halted, and all outputs may be forced off. [1] Run - Execution of the devices program occurs in this mode. Input and output (values, points, tags, elements, etc.) are monitored and used according to the programs logic.Program Upload and Program Download are disabled while in this mode. [2] [3] [1] [4] Remote - Allows for remote changes to a PLCs operation mode. [4] Stop - The PLC and program is stopped, while in this mode, outputs are forced off. [3] Reset - Conditions on the PLC are reset to their original states. Warm resets may retain some memory while cold resets will reset all I/O and data registers. [3] Test / Monitor mode - Similar to run mode, I/O is processed, although this mode allows for monitoring, force set, resets, and more generally tuning or debugging of the system. Often monitor mode may be used as a trial for initialization.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals.

Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that control the state of the user program and control access to the controllers API. Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the controllers API. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:  Program - This mode must be enabled before changes can be made to a devices program. This allows program uploads and downloads between the device and an engineering workstation. Often the PLCs logic Is halted, and all outputs may be forced off. [1] Run - Execution of the devices program occurs in this mode. Input and output (values, points, tags, elements, etc.) are monitored and used according to the programs logic. Program Upload and Program Download are disabled while in this mode. [2] [3] [1] [4] Remote - Allows for remote changes to a PLCs operation mode. [4] Stop - The PLC and program is stopped, while in this mode, outputs are forced off. [3] Reset - Conditions on the PLC are reset to their original states. Warm resets may retain some memory while cold resets will reset all I/O and data registers. [3] Test / Monitor mode - Similar to run mode, I/O is processed, although this mode allows for monitoring, force set, resets, and more generally tuning or debugging of the system. Often monitor mode may be used as a trial for initialization.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

CLIs provide a means of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many types of platforms and devices within control systems environments.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Allowlist techniques that operate at the application layer (e.g., DNP3, Modbus, HTTP) are addressed in the Filter Network Traffic mitigation.\n\n\n\n\n M0931 \n\n\n Network Intrusion Prevention \n\n\nNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific C2 protocol used by a particular adversary or tool and will likely be different across various malware families and versions. Adversaries will likely change tool C2 signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way as to avoid detection by common defensive tools.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems.

Publicly exposed applications may be found through online tools that scan the internet for open ports and services.

This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in Loss of Safety. Operations that result in Loss of Control may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of Loss of Productivity and Revenue. The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report. [1]  These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace. A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [2] [3] [4] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. This resulted in damage to impacted trams, people, and the surrounding property. Reportedly, four trams were derailed and were forced to make emergency stops. [3] Commands issued by the student may have also resulted in tram collisions, causing harm to those on board and the environment outside.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Two examples are Windows Sysinternals SDelete and Active@ Killdisk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0809\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Matan Dobrushin - Otorio\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can wipe the memory of Omron PLCs and reset settings through the remote HTTP service.[2][3][4] \n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer has a destructive wiper that overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files.

This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in Loss of Safety. Operations that result in Loss of Control may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of Loss of Productivity and Revenue. The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report. [1]  These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace. A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [2] [3] [4] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. This resulted in damage to impacted trams, people, and the surrounding property. Reportedly, four trams were derailed and were forced to make emergency stops. [3] Commands issued by the student may have also resulted in tram collisions, causing harm to those on board and the environment outside.

This ultimately led to 800,000 liters of raw sewage being spilled out into the community. The raw sewage affected local parks, rivers, and even a local hotel.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack.

This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in Loss of Safety. Operations that result in Loss of Control may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of Loss of Productivity and Revenue. The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report. [1]  These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace. A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [2] [3] [4] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. This resulted in damage to impacted trams, people, and the surrounding property. Reportedly, four trams were derailed and were forced to make emergency stops. [3] Commands issued by the student may have also resulted in tram collisions, causing harm to those on board and the environment outside.

This ultimately led to 800,000 liters of raw sewage being spilled out into the community. The raw sewage affected local parks, rivers, and even a local hotel.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack.

Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack.

Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well.

Information repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use can be non-trivial. At minimum, access to information repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user-based anomalies.\n\n\n\n\nDS0028\n\n\nLogon Session', metadata={'source': 'https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0811', 'title': 'Data from Information Repositories, Technique T0811 - ICS | MITRE ATT&CK®', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content=""Theft of Operational Information, Technique T0882 - ICS | MITRE ATT&CK®\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrices\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nTactics\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nTechniques\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nDefenses\n\n\nData Sources\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\nAssets\n\n\n\n\nCTI\n\n\nGroups\nSoftware\nCampaigns\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nGeneral Information\nGetting Started\nContribute\nTraining\nATT&CKcon\nWorking with ATT&CK\nFAQ\nUpdates\nVersions of ATT&CK\nRelated Projects\nBrand Guide\n\n\n\nBenefactors\n\n\n\nBlog\xa0\n        \n\n\n\nSearch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        ATT&CK v14 has been released!

Information repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use can be non-trivial. At minimum, access to information repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user-based anomalies.\n\n\n\n\nDS0028\n\n\nLogon Session', metadata={'source': 'https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0811', 'title': 'Data from Information Repositories, Technique T0811 - ICS | MITRE ATT&CK®', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Data from Local System, Technique T0893 - ICS | MITRE ATT&CK®\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrices\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nTactics\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nTechniques\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nDefenses\n\n\nData Sources\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\nAssets\n\n\n\n\nCTI\n\n\nGroups\nSoftware\nCampaigns\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nGeneral Information\nGetting Started\nContribute\nTraining\nATT&CKcon\nWorking with ATT&CK\nFAQ\nUpdates\nVersions of ATT&CK\nRelated Projects\nBrand Guide\n\n\n\nBenefactors\n\n\n\nBlog\xa0\n        \n\n\n\nSearch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        ATT&CK v14 has been released!

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

Out-of-band communication should utilize diverse systems and technologies to minimize common failure modes and vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure. For example, wireless networks (e.g., 3G, 4G) can be used to provide diverse and redundant delivery of data.\n\n\n\n\n M0811 \n\n\n Redundancy of Service \n\n\nHot-standbys in diverse locations can ensure continued operations if the primarily system is compromised or unavailable. At the network layer, protocols such as the Parallel Redundancy Protocol can be used to simultaneously use redundant and diverse communication over a local network.

Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment. Some ICS devices are particularly sensitive to DoS events, and may become unresponsive in reaction to even a simple ping sweep. Adversaries may also attempt to execute a Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) against certain devices, such as in the case of the BrickerBot malware. [1] Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to cause a denial of service by taking advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to cause a denial of service condition. Adversaries may have prior knowledge about industrial protocols or control devices used in the environment through Remote System Information Discovery. There are examples of adversaries remotely causing a Device Restart/Shutdown by exploiting a vulnerability that induces uncontrolled resource consumption.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment. Some ICS devices are particularly sensitive to DoS events, and may become unresponsive in reaction to even a simple ping sweep. Adversaries may also attempt to execute a Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) against certain devices, such as in the case of the BrickerBot malware. [1] Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to cause a denial of service by taking advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to cause a denial of service condition. Adversaries may have prior knowledge about industrial protocols or control devices used in the environment through Remote System Information Discovery. There are examples of adversaries remotely causing a Device Restart/Shutdown by exploiting a vulnerability that induces uncontrolled resource consumption.

Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment. Some ICS devices are particularly sensitive to DoS events, and may become unresponsive in reaction to even a simple ping sweep. Adversaries may also attempt to execute a Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) against certain devices, such as in the case of the BrickerBot malware. [1] Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to cause a denial of service by taking advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to cause a denial of service condition. Adversaries may have prior knowledge about industrial protocols or control devices used in the environment through Remote System Information Discovery. There are examples of adversaries remotely causing a Device Restart/Shutdown by exploiting a vulnerability that induces uncontrolled resource consumption.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases.

Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland.

As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops.

Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment. Some ICS devices are particularly sensitive to DoS events, and may become unresponsive in reaction to even a simple ping sweep. Adversaries may also attempt to execute a Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) against certain devices, such as in the case of the BrickerBot malware. [1] Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to cause a denial of service by taking advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to cause a denial of service condition. Adversaries may have prior knowledge about industrial protocols or control devices used in the environment through Remote System Information Discovery. There are examples of adversaries remotely causing a Device Restart/Shutdown by exploiting a vulnerability that induces uncontrolled resource consumption.

Operators were also denied service to their downstream devices when their serial-to-ethernet converters had their firmware overwritten, which bricked the devices.

Once this vulnerability is successfully exploited, the target device stops responding to any commands until it is rebooted manually. [6] Once the tool is executed it sends specifically crafted packets to port 50,000 of the target IP addresses using UDP. The UDP packet contains the following 18 byte payload: 0x11 49 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 28 9E.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors. [1] Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets. The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations. Initial access to the intended targets used watering hole attacks to target process control, ICS, and critical infrastructure related trade publications and informational websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0817\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n G1000 \n\n\n ALLANITE \n\n\nALLANITE leverages watering hole attacks to gain access into electric utilities.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors. [1] Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets. The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations. Initial access to the intended targets used watering hole attacks to target process control, ICS, and critical infrastructure related trade publications and informational websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0817\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n G1000 \n\n\n ALLANITE \n\n\nALLANITE leverages watering hole attacks to gain access into electric utilities.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

Older device firmware may be factory installed and require special reprograming equipment. When available, the firmware update feature enables vendors to remotely patch bugs and perform upgrades. Device firmware updates are often delegated to the user and may be done using a software update package. It may also be possible to perform this task over the network. An adversary may exploit the firmware update feature on accessible devices to upload malicious or out-of-date firmware. Malicious modification of device firmware may provide an adversary with root access to a device, given firmware is one of the lowest programming abstraction layers.

Control system devices often contain modular hardware devices. These devices may have their own set of firmware that is separate from the firmware of the main control system equipment.   This technique is similar to System Firmware, but is conducted on other system components that may not have the same capabilities or level of integrity checking. Although it results in a device re-image, malicious device firmware may provide persistent access to remaining devices. [1] An easy point of access for an adversary is the Ethernet card, which may have its own CPU, RAM, and operating system. The adversary may attack and likely exploit the computer on an Ethernet card. Exploitation of the Ethernet card computer may enable the adversary to accomplish additional attacks, such as the following: [1] Delayed Attack - The adversary may stage an attack in advance and choose when to launch it, such as at a particularly damaging time.  Brick the Ethernet Card - Malicious firmware may be programmed to result in an Ethernet card failure, requiring a factory return.  Random Attack or Failure - The adversary may load malicious firmware onto multiple field devices. Execution of an attack and the time it occurs is generated by a pseudo-random number generator.   A Field Device Worm - The adversary may choose to identify all field devices of the same model, with the end goal of performing a device-wide compromise.  Attack Other Cards on the Field Device - Although it is not the most important module in a field device, the Ethernet card is most accessible to the adversary and malware. Compromise of the Ethernet card may provide a more direct route to compromising other modules, such as the CPU module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0839\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Impair Process Control \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nTargeted Assets\n\n\n\nID\nAsset\n\n\n\n\n\n A0003 \n\n\n Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) \n\n\n\n\n A0010 \n\n\n Safety Controller \n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\n\n\nID\nMitigation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n M0801 \n\n\n Access Management \n\n\nAll devices or systems changes, including all administrative functions, should require authentication.

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions. [1] When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions. [1] When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.

Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent security features.  Adversaries may have prior knowledge through Remote System Information Discovery about security features implemented on control devices. These device security features will likely be targeted directly for exploitation.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

Access to a wireless network may be gained through the compromise of a wireless device. [1] [2] Adversaries may also utilize radios and other wireless communication devices on the same frequency as the wireless network. Wireless compromise can be done as an initial access vector from a remote distance. A Polish student used a modified TV remote controller to gain access to and control over the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [3] [4] The remote controller device allowed the student to interface with the trams network to modify track settings and override operator control. The adversary may have accomplished this by aligning the controller to the frequency and amplitude of IR control protocol signals. [5] The controller then enabled initial access to the network, allowing the capture and replay of tram signals.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Out-of-band communication should utilize diverse systems and technologies to minimize common failure modes and vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure. For example, wireless networks (e.g., 3G, 4G) can be used to provide diverse and redundant delivery of data.\n\n\n\n\n M0811 \n\n\n Redundancy of Service \n\n\nHot-standbys in diverse locations can ensure continued operations if the primarily system is compromised or unavailable. At the network layer, protocols such as the Parallel Redundancy Protocol can be used to simultaneously use redundant and diverse communication over a local network.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Examples credentials that may be hardcoded in an asset include:Username/PasswordsCryptographic keys/CertificatesAPI tokensUnlike Default Credentials, these credentials are built into the system in a way that they either cannot be changed by the asset owner, or may be infeasible to change because of the impact it would cause to the control system operation. These credentials may be reused across whole product lines or device models and are often not published or known to the owner and operators of the asset. Adversaries may utilize these hardcoded credentials to move throughout the control system environment or provide reliable access for their tools to interact with industrial assets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0891\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nLateral Movement,                                                        Persistence \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Aagam Shah, @neutrinoguy, ABB\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa029 September 2022\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can login to Omron PLCs using hardcoded credentials, which is documented in CVE-2022-34151.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet uses a hardcoded password in the WinCC software's database server as one of the mechanisms used to propagate to nearby systems.

Examples credentials that may be hardcoded in an asset include:Username/PasswordsCryptographic keys/CertificatesAPI tokensUnlike Default Credentials, these credentials are built into the system in a way that they either cannot be changed by the asset owner, or may be infeasible to change because of the impact it would cause to the control system operation. These credentials may be reused across whole product lines or device models and are often not published or known to the owner and operators of the asset. Adversaries may utilize these hardcoded credentials to move throughout the control system environment or provide reliable access for their tools to interact with industrial assets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0891\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nLateral Movement,                                                        Persistence \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Aagam Shah, @neutrinoguy, ABB\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa029 September 2022\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can login to Omron PLCs using hardcoded credentials, which is documented in CVE-2022-34151.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet uses a hardcoded password in the WinCC software's database server as one of the mechanisms used to propagate to nearby systems.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

Windows processes often leverage these API functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions. [1]One type of hooking seen in ICS involves redirecting calls to these functions via import address table (IAT) hooking. IAT hooking uses modifications to a process IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Windows processes often leverage these API functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions. [1]One type of hooking seen in ICS involves redirecting calls to these functions via import address table (IAT) hooking. IAT hooking uses modifications to a process IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

During the scan cycle, a PLC reads the status of all inputs and stores them in an image table. [1] The image table is the PLCs internal storage location where values of inputs/outputs for one scan are stored while it executes the user program. After the PLC has solved the entire logic program, it updates the output image table. The contents of this output image table are written to the corresponding output points in I/O Modules.The Input and Output Image tables described above make up the I/O Image on a PLC. This image is used by the user program instead of directly interacting with physical I/O. [2] Adversaries may collect the I/O Image state of a PLC by utilizing a devices Native API to access the memory regions directly. The collection of the PLCs I/O state could be used to replace values or inform future stages of an attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0877\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nCollection \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet copies the input area of an I/O image into data blocks with a one second interval between copies, forming a 21 second recording of the input area.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Two examples are Windows Sysinternals SDelete and Active@ Killdisk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0809\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Matan Dobrushin - Otorio\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can wipe the memory of Omron PLCs and reset settings through the remote HTTP service.[2][3][4] \n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer has a destructive wiper that overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland.

As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment. Some ICS devices are particularly sensitive to DoS events, and may become unresponsive in reaction to even a simple ping sweep. Adversaries may also attempt to execute a Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) against certain devices, such as in the case of the BrickerBot malware. [1] Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to cause a denial of service by taking advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to cause a denial of service condition. Adversaries may have prior knowledge about industrial protocols or control devices used in the environment through Remote System Information Discovery. There are examples of adversaries remotely causing a Device Restart/Shutdown by exploiting a vulnerability that induces uncontrolled resource consumption.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Two examples are Windows Sysinternals SDelete and Active@ Killdisk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0809\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Matan Dobrushin - Otorio\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can wipe the memory of Omron PLCs and reset settings through the remote HTTP service.[2][3][4] \n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer has a destructive wiper that overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

Methods of I/O image manipulation may include overriding the I/O table via direct memory manipulation or using the override function used for testing PLC programs. [1] During the scan cycle, a PLC reads the status of all inputs and stores them in an image table. [2] The image table is the PLCs internal storage location where values of inputs/outputs for one scan are stored while it executes the user program. After the PLC has solved the entire logic program, it updates the output image table. The contents of this output image table are written to the corresponding output points in I/O Modules. One of the unique characteristics of PLCs is their ability to override the status of a physical discrete input or to override the logic driving a physical output coil and force the output to a desired status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0835\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster may manipulate any outputs of the PLC.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

This manipulation may be short term or sustained. During this time the process itself could be in a much different state than what is reported. [1] [2] [3] Operators may be fooled into doing something that is harmful to the system in a loss of view situation. With a manipulated view into the systems, operators may issue inappropriate control sequences that introduce faults or catastrophic failures into the system.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent security features.  Adversaries may have prior knowledge through Remote System Information Discovery about security features implemented on control devices. These device security features will likely be targeted directly for exploitation.

Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting and modifying operating-system API calls that supply system information. Rootkits or rootkit-enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system, or lower. [1] Firmware rootkits that affect the operating system yield nearly full control of the system. While firmware rootkits are normally developed for the main processing board, they can also be developed for the I/O that is attached to an asset. Compromise of this firmware allows the modification of all of the process variables and functions the module engages in. This may result in commands being disregarded and false information being fed to the main device. By tampering with device processes, an adversary may inhibit its expected response functions and possibly enable Impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0851\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nEvasion,                                                        Inhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nOne of Stuxnet's rootkits is contained entirely in the fake s7otbxdx.dll.

This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in Loss of Safety. Operations that result in Loss of Control may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of Loss of Productivity and Revenue. The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report. [1]  These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace. A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [2] [3] [4] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. This resulted in damage to impacted trams, people, and the surrounding property. Reportedly, four trams were derailed and were forced to make emergency stops. [3] Commands issued by the student may have also resulted in tram collisions, causing harm to those on board and the environment outside.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes.

As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops.

Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in Loss of Safety. Operations that result in Loss of Control may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of Loss of Productivity and Revenue. The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report. [1]  These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace. A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [2] [3] [4] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. This resulted in damage to impacted trams, people, and the surrounding property. Reportedly, four trams were derailed and were forced to make emergency stops. [3] Commands issued by the student may have also resulted in tram collisions, causing harm to those on board and the environment outside.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Modification to controller programs can be accomplished using a Program Download in addition to other types of program modification such as online edit and program append. Program modification encompasses the addition and modification of instructions and logic contained in Program Organization Units (POU)  [1] and similar programming elements found on controllers. This can include, for example, adding new functions to a controller, modifying the logic in existing functions and making new calls from one function to another.

Out-of-band communication should utilize diverse systems and technologies to minimize common failure modes and vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure. For example, wireless networks (e.g., 3G, 4G) can be used to provide diverse and redundant delivery of data.\n\n\n\n\n M0811 \n\n\n Redundancy of Service \n\n\nHot-standbys in diverse locations can ensure continued operations if the primarily system is compromised or unavailable. At the network layer, protocols such as the Parallel Redundancy Protocol can be used to simultaneously use redundant and diverse communication over a local network.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes.

Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

[1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent security features.  Adversaries may have prior knowledge through Remote System Information Discovery about security features implemented on control devices. These device security features will likely be targeted directly for exploitation.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

An adversary may attempt to sniff the traffic to gain information about the target. This information can vary in the level of importance. Relatively unimportant information is general communications to and from machines.  Relatively important information would be login information. User credentials may be sent over an unencrypted protocol, such as Telnet, that can be captured and obtained through network packet analysis. In addition, ARP and Domain Name Service (DNS) poisoning can be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0842\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can deploy Tcpdump to sniff network traffic and collect PCAP files.[2] \n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nDP_RECV is the name of a standard function block used by network coprocessors. It is used to receive network frames on the Profibus  a standard industrial network bus used for distributed I/O. The original block is copied to FC1869, and then replaced by a malicious block. Each time the function is used to receive a packet, the malicious Stuxnet block takes control: it will call the original DP_RECV in FC1869 and then perform postprocessing on the packet data. The replaced DP_RECV block (later on referred to as the DP_RECV monitor) is meant to monitor data sent by the frequency converter drives to the 315-2 CPU via CP 342-5 Profibus communication modules.

The malware uses a raw socket to look for connections to a pre-specified IP address, only looking at TCP packets that are 150 bytes or larger. Packets that are not on port 502, are scanned for BasicAuth, and that information is logged.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

"Knowing this ICS attack procedure <<DP_RECV is the name of a standard function block used by network coprocessors. It is used to receive network frames on the Profibus  a standard industrial network bus used for distributed I/O. The original block is copied to FC1869, and then replaced by a malicious block. Each time the function is used to receive a packet, the malicious Stuxnet block takes control: it will call the original DP_RECV in FC1869 and then perform postprocessing on the packet data. The replaced DP_RECV block (later on referred to as the DP_RECV monitor) is meant to monitor data sent by the frequency converter drives to the 315-2 CPU via CP 342-5 Profibus communication modules. >>, what MITRE ATT&CK ICS tactics will a cyber adversary achieve with this technique?","ICS tactic(s): Discovery, Collection","[Document(page_content=""DS0029\n\n\nNetwork Traffic\n\n\n\nNetwork Traffic Content\n\n\nMonitor for anomalies related to discovery related ICS functions, including devices that have not previously used these functions or for functions being sent to many outstations.

Relatively unimportant information is general communications to and from machines.  Relatively important information would be login information. User credentials may be sent over an unencrypted protocol, such as Telnet, that can be captured and obtained through network packet analysis. In addition, ARP and Domain Name Service (DNS) poisoning can be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0842\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can deploy Tcpdump to sniff network traffic and collect PCAP files.[2] \n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nDP_RECV is the name of a standard function block used by network coprocessors.

Each time the function is used to receive a packet, the malicious Stuxnet block takes control: it will call the original DP_RECV in FC1869 and then perform postprocessing on the packet data. The replaced DP_RECV block (later on referred to as the DP_RECV monitor) is meant to monitor data sent by the frequency converter drives to the 315-2 CPU via CP 342-5 Profibus communication modules.

[1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent security features.  Adversaries may have prior knowledge through Remote System Information Discovery about security features implemented on control devices. These device security features will likely be targeted directly for exploitation.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

"Knowing this ICS attack procedure <<Stuxnet enumerates and parses the System Data Blocks (SDB) using the s7blk_findfirst and s7blk_findnext API calls in s7otbxdx.dll. Stuxnet must find an SDB with the DWORD at offset 50h equal to 0100CB2Ch. This specifies that the system uses the Profibus communications processor module CP 342-5. In addition, specific values are searched for and counted: 7050h and 9500h. 7050h is assigned to part number KFC750V3 which appears to be a frequency converter drive (also known as variable frequency drive) manufactured by Fararo Paya in Teheran, Iran. 9500h is assigned to Vacon NX frequency converter drives manufactured by Vacon based in Finland.Stuxnet was specifically targeting CPUs 6ES7-315-2 (Series 300) with special system data block characteristics for sequence A or B and 6ES7-315-2 for sequence C.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

It then searches the logical nodes for the CSW value, which indicates the device performs a circuit breaker or switch control function.[5]Industroyer's OPC DA module also uses IOPCBrowseServerAddressSpace to look for items with the following strings: ctlSelOn, ctlOperOn, ctlSelOff, ctlOperOff, Pos and stVal.[5]Industroyer IEC 60870-5-104 module includes a range mode to discover Information Object Addresses (IOAs) by enumerating through each.[5]\n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 has the capability to poll a target device about its connection status, data transfer status, Common Address (CA), Information Object Addresses (IOAs), and IO state values across multiple priority levels.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet enumerates and parses the System Data Blocks (SDB) using the s7blk_findfirst and s7blk_findnext API calls in s7otbxdx.dll. Stuxnet must find an SDB with the DWORD at offset 50h equal to 0100CB2Ch. This specifies that the system uses the Profibus communications processor module CP 342-5. In addition, specific values are searched for and counted: 7050h and 9500h. 7050h is assigned to part number KFC750V3 which appears to be a frequency converter drive (also known as variable frequency drive) manufactured by Fararo Paya in Teheran, Iran. 9500h is assigned to Vacon NX frequency converter drives manufactured by Vacon based in Finland.[8]Stuxnet was specifically targeting CPUs 6ES7-315-2 (Series 300) with special system data block characteristics for sequence A or B and 6ES7-315-2 for sequence C.

The adversary may rely on unknowing trusted third parties, such as suppliers or contractors with access privileges, to introduce the removable media. This technique enables initial access to target devices that never connect to untrusted networks, but are physically accessible.     Operators of the German nuclear power plant, Gundremmingen, discovered malware on a facility computer not connected to the internet. [1] [2] The malware included Conficker and W32.Ramnit, which were also found on eighteen removable disk drives in the facility. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The plant has since checked for infection and cleaned up more than 1,000 computers.

The adversary may rely on unknowing trusted third parties, such as suppliers or contractors with access privileges, to introduce the removable media. This technique enables initial access to target devices that never connect to untrusted networks, but are physically accessible.     Operators of the German nuclear power plant, Gundremmingen, discovered malware on a facility computer not connected to the internet. [1] [2] The malware included Conficker and W32.Ramnit, which were also found on eighteen removable disk drives in the facility. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The plant has since checked for infection and cleaned up more than 1,000 computers. [9] An ESET researcher commented that internet disconnection does not guarantee system safety from infection or payload execution.

Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting and modifying operating-system API calls that supply system information. Rootkits or rootkit-enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system, or lower. [1] Firmware rootkits that affect the operating system yield nearly full control of the system. While firmware rootkits are normally developed for the main processing board, they can also be developed for the I/O that is attached to an asset. Compromise of this firmware allows the modification of all of the process variables and functions the module engages in. This may result in commands being disregarded and false information being fed to the main device. By tampering with device processes, an adversary may inhibit its expected response functions and possibly enable Impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0851\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nEvasion,                                                        Inhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nOne of Stuxnet's rootkits is contained entirely in the fake s7otbxdx.dll.

Stuxnet contains code to monitor and intercept these types of requests. The rootkit modifies these requests so that Stuxnets PLC code is not discovered or damaged.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in Loss of Safety. Operations that result in Loss of Control may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of Loss of Productivity and Revenue. The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report. [1]  These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace. A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [2] [3] [4] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. This resulted in damage to impacted trams, people, and the surrounding property. Reportedly, four trams were derailed and were forced to make emergency stops. [3] Commands issued by the student may have also resulted in tram collisions, causing harm to those on board and the environment outside.

In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. Reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system or identifying important events such as deviations from expected values. If an adversary has the ability to Spoof Reporting Messages, they can impact the control system in many ways. The adversary can Spoof Reporting Messages that state that the process is operating normally, as a form of evasion.

Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting and modifying operating-system API calls that supply system information. Rootkits or rootkit-enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system, or lower. [1] Firmware rootkits that affect the operating system yield nearly full control of the system. While firmware rootkits are normally developed for the main processing board, they can also be developed for the I/O that is attached to an asset. Compromise of this firmware allows the modification of all of the process variables and functions the module engages in. This may result in commands being disregarded and false information being fed to the main device.

In order to continue existing undetected on the PLC it needs to account for at least the following situations: read requests for its own malicious code blocks, read requests for infected blocks (OB1, OB35, DP_RECV), and write requests that could overwrite Stuxnets own code. Stuxnet contains code to monitor and intercept these types of requests. The rootkit modifies these requests so that Stuxnets PLC code is not discovered or damaged.

The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases. [1] [2] [3] An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages. Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior. The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0815\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer is able to block serial COM channels temporarily causing a denial of view.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent security features.  Adversaries may have prior knowledge through Remote System Information Discovery about security features implemented on control devices. These device security features will likely be targeted directly for exploitation. There are examples of firmware RAM/ROM consistency checks on control devices being targeted by adversaries to enable the installation of malicious System Firmware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0820\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1009 \n\n\n Triton \n\n\nTriton disables a firmware RAM/ROM consistency check after injects a payload (imain.bin) into the firmware memory region.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before.

Windows processes often leverage these API functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions. [1]One type of hooking seen in ICS involves redirecting calls to these functions via import address table (IAT) hooking.

In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. Reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system or identifying important events such as deviations from expected values. If an adversary has the ability to Spoof Reporting Messages, they can impact the control system in many ways. The adversary can Spoof Reporting Messages that state that the process is operating normally, as a form of evasion.

At the network layer, protocols such as the Parallel Redundancy Protocol can be used to simultaneously use redundant and diverse communication over a local network.

Access to a wireless network may be gained through the compromise of a wireless device. [1] [2] Adversaries may also utilize radios and other wireless communication devices on the same frequency as the wireless network. Wireless compromise can be done as an initial access vector from a remote distance. A Polish student used a modified TV remote controller to gain access to and control over the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [3] [4] The remote controller device allowed the student to interface with the trams network to modify track settings and override operator control. The adversary may have accomplished this by aligning the controller to the frequency and amplitude of IR control protocol signals. [5] The controller then enabled initial access to the network, allowing the capture and replay of tram signals.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

There are examples of firmware RAM/ROM consistency checks on control devices being targeted by adversaries to enable the installation of malicious System Firmware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0820\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1009 \n\n\n Triton \n\n\nTriton disables a firmware RAM/ROM consistency check after injects a payload (imain.bin) into the firmware memory region.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent security features.  Adversaries may have prior knowledge through Remote System Information Discovery about security features implemented on control devices. These device security features will likely be targeted directly for exploitation. There are examples of firmware RAM/ROM consistency checks on control devices being targeted by adversaries to enable the installation of malicious System Firmware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0820\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1009 \n\n\n Triton \n\n\nTriton disables a firmware RAM/ROM consistency check after injects a payload (imain.bin) into the firmware memory region.

At minimum, access to information repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user-based anomalies.\n\n\n\n\nDS0028\n\n\nLogon Session', metadata={'source': 'https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0811', 'title': 'Data from Information Repositories, Technique T0811 - ICS | MITRE ATT&CK®', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Exploitation for Evasion, Technique T0820 - ICS | MITRE ATT&CK®\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrices\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nTactics\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nTechniques\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nDefenses\n\n\nData Sources\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\nAssets\n\n\n\n\nCTI\n\n\nGroups\nSoftware\nCampaigns\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nGeneral Information\nGetting Started\nContribute\nTraining\nATT&CKcon\nWorking with ATT&CK\nFAQ\nUpdates\nVersions of ATT&CK\nRelated Projects\nBrand Guide\n\n\n\nBenefactors\n\n\n\nBlog\xa0\n        \n\n\n\nSearch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        ATT&CK v14 has been released!

Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent security features.

This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in Loss of Safety. Operations that result in Loss of Control may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of Loss of Productivity and Revenue. The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report. [1]  These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace. A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [2] [3] [4] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. This resulted in damage to impacted trams, people, and the surrounding property. Reportedly, four trams were derailed and were forced to make emergency stops. [3] Commands issued by the student may have also resulted in tram collisions, causing harm to those on board and the environment outside.

This ultimately led to 800,000 liters of raw sewage being spilled out into the community. The raw sewage affected local parks, rivers, and even a local hotel.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior.

In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. Reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system or identifying important events such as deviations from expected values. If an adversary has the ability to Spoof Reporting Messages, they can impact the control system in many ways. The adversary can Spoof Reporting Messages that state that the process is operating normally, as a form of evasion. The adversary could also Spoof Reporting Messages to make the defenders and operators think that other errors are occurring in order to distract them from the actual source of a problem.

A Polish student used a modified TV remote controller to gain access to and control over the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [3] [4] The remote controller device allowed the student to interface with the trams network to modify track settings and override operator control. The adversary may have accomplished this by aligning the controller to the frequency and amplitude of IR control protocol signals. [5] The controller then enabled initial access to the network, allowing the capture and replay of tram signals.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent security features.  Adversaries may have prior knowledge through Remote System Information Discovery about security features implemented on control devices. These device security features will likely be targeted directly for exploitation.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

Access to a wireless network may be gained through the compromise of a wireless device. [1] [2] Adversaries may also utilize radios and other wireless communication devices on the same frequency as the wireless network. Wireless compromise can be done as an initial access vector from a remote distance. A Polish student used a modified TV remote controller to gain access to and control over the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [3] [4] The remote controller device allowed the student to interface with the trams network to modify track settings and override operator control. The adversary may have accomplished this by aligning the controller to the frequency and amplitude of IR control protocol signals. [5] The controller then enabled initial access to the network, allowing the capture and replay of tram signals.

RF communication frequencies vary between 3 kHz to 300 GHz, although are commonly between 300 MHz to 6 GHz. [1]  The wavelength and frequency of the signal affect how the signal propagates through open air, obstacles (e.g. walls and trees) and the type of radio required to capture them. These characteristics are often standardized in the protocol and hardware and may have an effect on how the signal is captured. Some examples of wireless protocols that may be found in cyber-physical environments are: WirelessHART, Zigbee, WIA-FA, and 700 MHz Public Safety Spectrum. Adversaries may capture RF communications by using specialized hardware, such as software defined radio (SDR), handheld radio, or a computer with radio demodulator tuned to the communication frequency. [2] Information transmitted over a wireless medium may be captured in-transit whether the sniffing device is the intended destination or not. This technique may be particularly useful to an adversary when the communications are not encrypted. [3] In the 2017 Dallas Siren incident, it is suspected that adversaries likely captured wireless command message broadcasts on a 700 MHz frequency during a regular test of the system. These messages were later replayed to trigger the alarm systems.

In cases where the adversary interacts with the wireless network (e.g., joining a Wi-Fi network) detection may be possible. Monitor for new or irregular network traffic flows which may indicate potentially unwanted devices or sessions on wireless networks.  In Wi-Fi networks monitor for changes such as rogue access points or low signal strength, indicating a device is further away from the access point then expected and changes in the physical layer signal.[5] [6]  Network traffic content will provide important context, such as hardware (e.g., MAC) addresses, user accounts, and types of messages sent.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Candell, R., Hany, M., Lee, K.
