Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment. Some ICS devices are particularly sensitive to DoS events, and may become unresponsive in reaction to even a simple ping sweep. Adversaries may also attempt to execute a Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) against certain devices, such as in the case of the BrickerBot malware. [1] Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to cause a denial of service by taking advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to cause a denial of service condition. Adversaries may have prior knowledge about industrial protocols or control devices used in the environment through Remote System Information Discovery. There are examples of adversaries remotely causing a Device Restart/Shutdown by exploiting a vulnerability that induces uncontrolled resource consumption.

Allowlist techniques that operate at the application layer (e.g., DNP3, Modbus, HTTP) are addressed in the Filter Network Traffic mitigation.\n\n\n\n\n M0931 \n\n\n Network Intrusion Prevention \n\n\nNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific C2 protocol used by a particular adversary or tool and will likely be different across various malware families and versions. Adversaries will likely change tool C2 signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way as to avoid detection by common defensive tools.

An adversary may attempt to sniff the traffic to gain information about the target. This information can vary in the level of importance. Relatively unimportant information is general communications to and from machines.  Relatively important information would be login information. User credentials may be sent over an unencrypted protocol, such as Telnet, that can be captured and obtained through network packet analysis. In addition, ARP and Domain Name Service (DNS) poisoning can be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0842\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can deploy Tcpdump to sniff network traffic and collect PCAP files.[2] \n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nDP_RECV is the name of a standard function block used by network coprocessors. It is used to receive network frames on the Profibus  a standard industrial network bus used for distributed I/O. The original block is copied to FC1869, and then replaced by a malicious block. Each time the function is used to receive a packet, the malicious Stuxnet block takes control: it will call the original DP_RECV in FC1869 and then perform postprocessing on the packet data. The replaced DP_RECV block (later on referred to as the DP_RECV monitor) is meant to monitor data sent by the frequency converter drives to the 315-2 CPU via CP 342-5 Profibus communication modules.

The malware uses a raw socket to look for connections to a pre-specified IP address, only looking at TCP packets that are 150 bytes or larger. Packets that are not on port 502, are scanned for BasicAuth, and that information is logged. This may have allowed credential harvesting from communications between devices accessing a modbus-enabled HMI.

Normally, transient assets are brought into an environment by authorized personnel and do not remain in that environment on a permanent basis. [1] Transient assets are commonly needed to support management functions and may be more common in systems where a remotely managed asset is not feasible, external connections for remote access do not exist, or 3rd party contractor/vendor access is required. Adversaries may take advantage of transient assets in different ways. For instance, adversaries may target a transient asset when it is connected to an external network and then leverage its trusted access in another environment to launch an attack. They may also take advantage of installed applications and libraries that are used by legitimate end-users to interact with control system devices. Transient assets, in some cases, may not be deployed with a secure configuration leading to weaknesses that could allow an adversary to propagate malicious executable code, e.g., the transient asset may be infected by malware and when connected to an ICS environment the malware propagates onto other systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0864\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa014 October 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0020 \n\n\n Maroochy Water Breach \n\n\nIn the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary utilized a computer, possibly stolen, with proprietary engineering software to communicate with a wastewater system.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeted Assets\n\n\n\nID\nAsset\n\n\n\n\n\n A0001 \n\n\n Workstation \n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\n\n\nID\nMitigation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n M0949 \n\n\n Antivirus/Antimalware \n\n\nInstall anti-virus software on all workstation and transient assets that may have external access, such as to web, email, or remote file shares.\n\n\n\n\n M0947 \n\n\n Audit \n\n\nIntegrity checking of transient assets can include performing the validation of the booted operating system and programs using TPM-based technologies, such as Secure Boot and Trusted Boot.

Reporting messages are a standard part of data acquisition in control systems. Reporting messages are used as a way to transmit system state information and acknowledgements that specific actions have occurred. These messages provide vital information for the management of a physical process, and keep operators, engineers, and administrators aware of the state of system devices and physical processes. If an adversary is able to change the reporting settings, certain events could be prevented from being reported. This type of modification can also prevent operators or devices from performing actions to keep the system in a safe state. If critical reporting messages cannot trigger these actions then a Impact could occur. In ICS environments, the adversary may have to use Alarm Suppression or contend with multiple alarms and/or alarm propagation to achieve a specific goal to evade detection or prevent intended responses from occurring.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

Understanding the points being collected may inform an adversary on which processes and values to keep track of over the course of an operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0861\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nCollection \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Jos Wetzels - Midnight Blue\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload has the capability of enumerating OPC tags, in addition to more generic OPC server information.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

A serial to Ethernet converter may have a few ports open to facilitate multiple communications. For example, if there are three serial COM available -- 1, 2 and 3 --, the converter might be listening on the corresponding ports 20001, 20002, and 20003. If a TCP/IP connection is opened with one of these ports and held open, then the port will be unavailable for use by another party. One way the adversary could achieve this would be to initiate a TCP session with the serial to Ethernet converter at 10.0.0.1 via Telnet on serial port 1 with the following command: telnet 10.0.0.1 20001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0805\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team overwrote the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware, rendering the devices not operational.

In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. By blocking these reporting messages, an adversary can potentially hide their actions from an operator.Blocking reporting messages in control systems that manage physical processes may contribute to system impact, causing inhibition of a response function. A control system may not be able to respond in a proper or timely manner to an event, such as a dangerous fault, if its corresponding reporting message is blocked.

One way the adversary could achieve this would be to initiate a TCP session with the serial to Ethernet converter at 10.0.0.1 via Telnet on serial port 1 with the following command: telnet 10.0.0.1 20001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0805\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team overwrote the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware, rendering the devices not operational.

In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. By blocking these reporting messages, an adversary can potentially hide their actions from an operator.Blocking reporting messages in control systems that manage physical processes may contribute to system impact, causing inhibition of a response function. A control system may not be able to respond in a proper or timely manner to an event, such as a dangerous fault, if its corresponding reporting message is blocked.

Serial Communication ports (COM) allow communication with control system devices. Devices can receive command and configuration messages over such serial COM. Devices also use serial COM to send command and reporting messages. Blocking device serial COM may also block command messages and block reporting messages. A serial to Ethernet converter is often connected to a serial COM to facilitate communication between serial and Ethernet devices. One approach to blocking a serial COM would be to create and hold open a TCP session with the Ethernet side of the converter. A serial to Ethernet converter may have a few ports open to facilitate multiple communications. For example, if there are three serial COM available -- 1, 2 and 3 --, the converter might be listening on the corresponding ports 20001, 20002, and 20003. If a TCP/IP connection is opened with one of these ports and held open, then the port will be unavailable for use by another party. One way the adversary could achieve this would be to initiate a TCP session with the serial to Ethernet converter at 10.0.0.1 via Telnet on serial port 1 with the following command: telnet 10.0.0.1 20001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0805\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team overwrote the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware, rendering the devices not operational.

Serial Communication ports (COM) allow communication with control system devices. Devices can receive command and configuration messages over such serial COM. Devices also use serial COM to send command and reporting messages. Blocking device serial COM may also block command messages and block reporting messages. A serial to Ethernet converter is often connected to a serial COM to facilitate communication between serial and Ethernet devices. One approach to blocking a serial COM would be to create and hold open a TCP session with the Ethernet side of the converter. A serial to Ethernet converter may have a few ports open to facilitate multiple communications. For example, if there are three serial COM available -- 1, 2 and 3 --, the converter might be listening on the corresponding ports 20001, 20002, and 20003. If a TCP/IP connection is opened with one of these ports and held open, then the port will be unavailable for use by another party.

Serial Communication ports (COM) allow communication with control system devices. Devices can receive command and configuration messages over such serial COM. Devices also use serial COM to send command and reporting messages. Blocking device serial COM may also block command messages and block reporting messages. A serial to Ethernet converter is often connected to a serial COM to facilitate communication between serial and Ethernet devices. One approach to blocking a serial COM would be to create and hold open a TCP session with the Ethernet side of the converter. A serial to Ethernet converter may have a few ports open to facilitate multiple communications. For example, if there are three serial COM available -- 1, 2 and 3 --, the converter might be listening on the corresponding ports 20001, 20002, and 20003. If a TCP/IP connection is opened with one of these ports and held open, then the port will be unavailable for use by another party. One way the adversary could achieve this would be to initiate a TCP session with the serial to Ethernet converter at 10.0.0.1 via Telnet on serial port 1 with the following command: telnet 10.0.0.1 20001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0805\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team overwrote the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware, rendering the devices not operational.

In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. By blocking these reporting messages, an adversary can potentially hide their actions from an operator.Blocking reporting messages in control systems that manage physical processes may contribute to system impact, causing inhibition of a response function. A control system may not be able to respond in a proper or timely manner to an event, such as a dangerous fault, if its corresponding reporting message is blocked.

"Knowing this ICS attack procedure <<The Industroyer IEC 104 module has 3 modes available to perform its attack. These modes are range, shift, and sequence. The range mode operates in 2 stages. The first stage of range mode gathers Information Object Addresses (IOA) and sends select and execute packets to switch the state. The second stage of range mode has an infinite loop where it will switch the state of all of the previously discovered IOAs. Shift mode is similar to range mode, but instead of staying within the same range, it will add a shift value to the default range values. >>, what MITRE ATT&CK ICS tactics will a cyber adversary achieve with this technique?","ICS Tactics: Impair Process Control, Discovery","[Document(page_content='A0005 \n\n\n Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) \n\n\n\n\n A0012 \n\n\n Jump Host \n\n\n\n\n A0003 \n\n\n Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) \n\n\n\n\n A0004 \n\n\n Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) \n\n\n\n\n A0010 \n\n\n Safety Controller \n\n\n\n\n A0011 \n\n\n Virtual Private Network (VPN) Server \n\n\n\n\n A0001 \n\n\n Workstation \n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\n\n\nID\nMitigation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n M0814 \n\n\n Static Network Configuration \n\n\nICS environments typically have more statically defined devices, therefore minimize the use of both IT discovery protocols (e.g., DHCP, LLDP) and discovery functions in automation protocols.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Two examples are Windows Sysinternals SDelete and Active@ Killdisk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0809\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Matan Dobrushin - Otorio\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can wipe the memory of Omron PLCs and reset settings through the remote HTTP service.[2][3][4] \n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer has a destructive wiper that overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files.

This can include, for example, adding new functions to a controller, modifying the logic in existing functions and making new calls from one function to another. Some programs may allow an adversary to interact directly with the native API of the controller to take advantage of obscure features or vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0889\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nPersistence \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa020 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster copies itself to various Program Organization Units (POU) on the target device.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Correlation of other events with behavior surrounding API function calls using API monitoring will provide additional context to an event that may assist in determining if it is due to malicious behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Jos Wetzels 2018, January 16 Analyzing the TRITON industrial malware Retrieved. 2019/10/22 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        McCarthy, J et al. 2018, July NIST SP 1800-2 Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities Retrieved. 2020/09/17 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        MITRE 2020, June CWE CATEGORY: 7PK - API Abuse Retrieved. 2020/09/25 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nload more results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 Â© 2015-2023, The MITRE Corporation.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before.

CLIs provide a means of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many types of platforms and devices within control systems environments. [1] Adversaries may also use CLIs to install and run new software, including malicious tools that may be installed over the course of an operation.CLIs are typically accessed locally, but can also be exposed via services, such as SSH, Telnet, and RDP.  Commands that are executed in the CLI execute with the current permissions level of the process running the terminal emulator, unless the command specifies a change in permissions context. Many controllers have CLI interfaces for management purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0807\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team supplied the name of the payload DLL to Industroyer via a command line parameter.[2]\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nThe name of the Industroyer payload DLL is supplied by the attackers via a command line parameter supplied in one of the main backdoors execute a shell command commands.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

The adversary may rely on unknowing trusted third parties, such as suppliers or contractors with access privileges, to introduce the removable media. This technique enables initial access to target devices that never connect to untrusted networks, but are physically accessible.     Operators of the German nuclear power plant, Gundremmingen, discovered malware on a facility computer not connected to the internet. [1] [2] The malware included Conficker and W32.Ramnit, which were also found on eighteen removable disk drives in the facility. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The plant has since checked for infection and cleaned up more than 1,000 computers. [9] An ESET researcher commented that internet disconnection does not guarantee system safety from infection or payload execution.

Once it has infected a computer, Conficker automatically copies itself to all visible open drive shares on other computers inside the network. [11] Nuclear power plant officials suspect someone brought in Conficker by accident on a USB thumb drive, either from home or computers found in the power plant's facility. [4]\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet was able to self-replicate by being spread through removable drives.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

Normally, transient assets are brought into an environment by authorized personnel and do not remain in that environment on a permanent basis. [1] Transient assets are commonly needed to support management functions and may be more common in systems where a remotely managed asset is not feasible, external connections for remote access do not exist, or 3rd party contractor/vendor access is required. Adversaries may take advantage of transient assets in different ways. For instance, adversaries may target a transient asset when it is connected to an external network and then leverage its trusted access in another environment to launch an attack. They may also take advantage of installed applications and libraries that are used by legitimate end-users to interact with control system devices. Transient assets, in some cases, may not be deployed with a secure configuration leading to weaknesses that could allow an adversary to propagate malicious executable code, e.g., the transient asset may be infected by malware and when connected to an ICS environment the malware propagates onto other systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0864\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa014 October 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0020 \n\n\n Maroochy Water Breach \n\n\nIn the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary utilized a computer, possibly stolen, with proprietary engineering software to communicate with a wastewater system.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeted Assets\n\n\n\nID\nAsset\n\n\n\n\n\n A0001 \n\n\n Workstation \n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\n\n\nID\nMitigation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n M0949 \n\n\n Antivirus/Antimalware \n\n\nInstall anti-virus software on all workstation and transient assets that may have external access, such as to web, email, or remote file shares.\n\n\n\n\n M0947 \n\n\n Audit \n\n\nIntegrity checking of transient assets can include performing the validation of the booted operating system and programs using TPM-based technologies, such as Secure Boot and Trusted Boot.

These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters. Such parameters can determine the extent to which an action is performed and may specify additional options. For example, a program on a control system device dictating motor processes may take a parameter defining the total number of seconds to run that motor.      An adversary can potentially modify these parameters to produce an outcome outside of what was intended by the operators. By modifying system and process critical parameters, the adversary may cause Impact to equipment and/or control processes. Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations. For example, specifying that a process run for more or less time than it should, or dictating an unusually high, low, or invalid value as a parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0836\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpair Process Control \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.3\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the HTTP CGI scripts on Omron PLCs to modify parameters on EtherCat connected servo drives.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 modifies specified Information Object Addresses (IOAs) for specified Application Service Data Unit (ASDU) addresses to either the ON or OFF state.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n C0020 \n\n\n Maroochy Water Breach \n\n\nIn the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment. Some ICS devices are particularly sensitive to DoS events, and may become unresponsive in reaction to even a simple ping sweep. Adversaries may also attempt to execute a Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) against certain devices, such as in the case of the BrickerBot malware. [1] Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to cause a denial of service by taking advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to cause a denial of service condition. Adversaries may have prior knowledge about industrial protocols or control devices used in the environment through Remote System Information Discovery. There are examples of adversaries remotely causing a Device Restart/Shutdown by exploiting a vulnerability that induces uncontrolled resource consumption.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Two examples are Windows Sysinternals SDelete and Active@ Killdisk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0809\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Matan Dobrushin - Otorio\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can wipe the memory of Omron PLCs and reset settings through the remote HTTP service.[2][3][4] \n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer has a destructive wiper that overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files.

Operators were therefore unable to recover from the incident through their traditional means. Much of the power was restored manually.

Ensure backup and storage systems are hardened and kept separate from the corporate network to prevent compromise.  Maintain and exercise incident response plans  [9], including the management of gold-copy back-up images and configurations for key systems to enable quick recovery and response from adversarial activities that impact control, view, or availability.\n\n\n\n\n M0810 \n\n\n Out-of-Band Communications Channel \n\n\nProvide operators with redundant, out-of-band communication to support monitoring and control of the operational processes, especially when recovering from a network outage  [10]. Out-of-band communication should utilize diverse systems and technologies to minimize common failure modes and vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure. For example, wireless networks (e.g., 3G, 4G) can be used to provide diverse and redundant delivery of data.\n\n\n\n\n M0811 \n\n\n Redundancy of Service \n\n\nHot-standbys in diverse locations can ensure continued operations if the primarily system are compromised or unavailable. At the network layer, protocols such as the Parallel Redundancy Protocol can be used to simultaneously use redundant and diverse communication over a local network.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

Operators were therefore unable to recover from the incident through their traditional means. Much of the power was restored manually. [5]\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer's data wiper component removes the registry image path throughout the system and overwrites all files, rendering the system unusable. [6]\n\n\n\n\n S0372 \n\n\n LockerGoga \n\n\nSome of Norsk Hydro's production systems were impacted by a LockerGoga infection. This resulted in a loss of control which forced the company to switch to manual operations.

Ensure backup and storage systems are hardened and kept separate from the corporate network to prevent compromise.  Maintain and exercise incident response plans  [9], including the management of gold-copy back-up images and configurations for key systems to enable quick recovery and response from adversarial activities that impact control, view, or availability.\n\n\n\n\n M0810 \n\n\n Out-of-Band Communications Channel \n\n\nProvide operators with redundant, out-of-band communication to support monitoring and control of the operational processes, especially when recovering from a network outage  [10]. Out-of-band communication should utilize diverse systems and technologies to minimize common failure modes and vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure. For example, wireless networks (e.g., 3G, 4G) can be used to provide diverse and redundant delivery of data.\n\n\n\n\n M0811 \n\n\n Redundancy of Service \n\n\nHot-standbys in diverse locations can ensure continued operations if the primarily system are compromised or unavailable. At the network layer, protocols such as the Parallel Redundancy Protocol can be used to simultaneously use redundant and diverse communication over a local network.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors. [1] Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets. The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations. Initial access to the intended targets used watering hole attacks to target process control, ICS, and critical infrastructure related trade publications and informational websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0817\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n G1000 \n\n\n ALLANITE \n\n\nALLANITE leverages watering hole attacks to gain access into electric utilities.

The adversary may rely on unknowing trusted third parties, such as suppliers or contractors with access privileges, to introduce the removable media. This technique enables initial access to target devices that never connect to untrusted networks, but are physically accessible.     Operators of the German nuclear power plant, Gundremmingen, discovered malware on a facility computer not connected to the internet. [1] [2] The malware included Conficker and W32.Ramnit, which were also found on eighteen removable disk drives in the facility. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The plant has since checked for infection and cleaned up more than 1,000 computers. [9] An ESET researcher commented that internet disconnection does not guarantee system safety from infection or payload execution.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

Out-of-band communication should utilize diverse systems and technologies to minimize common failure modes and vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure. For example, wireless networks (e.g., 3G, 4G) can be used to provide diverse and redundant delivery of data.\n\n\n\n\n M0811 \n\n\n Redundancy of Service \n\n\nHot-standbys in diverse locations can ensure continued operations if the primarily system are compromised or unavailable. At the network layer, protocols such as the Parallel Redundancy Protocol can be used to simultaneously use redundant and diverse communication over a local network.

Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that control the state of the user program and control access to the controllers API. Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the controllers API. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:  Program - This mode must be enabled before changes can be made to a devices program. This allows program uploads and downloads between the device and an engineering workstation. Often the PLCs logic Is halted, and all outputs may be forced off. [1] Run - Execution of the devices program occurs in this mode. Input and output (values, points, tags, elements, etc.) are monitored and used according to the programs logic. Program Upload and Program Download are disabled while in this mode. [2] [3] [1] [4] Remote - Allows for remote changes to a PLCs operation mode. [4] Stop - The PLC and program is stopped, while in this mode, outputs are forced off. [3] Reset - Conditions on the PLC are reset to their original states. Warm resets may retain some memory while cold resets will reset all I/O and data registers. [3] Test / Monitor mode - Similar to run mode, I/O is processed, although this mode allows for monitoring, force set, resets, and more generally tuning or debugging of the system. Often monitor mode may be used as a trial for initialization.

As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact resulted in damage and unsafe conditions from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0827\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Dragos Threat Intelligence\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, operators were shut out of their equipment either through the denial of peripheral use or the degradation of equipment. Operators were therefore unable to recover from the incident through their traditional means. Much of the power was restored manually.

[6]\n\n\n\n\n S0372 \n\n\n LockerGoga \n\n\nSome of Norsk Hydro's production systems were impacted by a LockerGoga infection. This resulted in a loss of control which forced the company to switch to manual operations.

Ensure backup and storage systems are hardened and kept separate from the corporate network to prevent compromise.  Maintain and exercise incident response plans  [9], including the management of gold-copy back-up images and configurations for key systems to enable quick recovery and response from adversarial activities that impact control, view, or availability.\n\n\n\n\n M0810 \n\n\n Out-of-Band Communications Channel \n\n\nProvide operators with redundant, out-of-band communication to support monitoring and control of the operational processes, especially when recovering from a network outage  [10]. Out-of-band communication should utilize diverse systems and technologies to minimize common failure modes and vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure. For example, wireless networks (e.g., 3G, 4G) can be used to provide diverse and redundant delivery of data.\n\n\n\n\n M0811 \n\n\n Redundancy of Service \n\n\nHot-standbys in diverse locations can ensure continued operations if the primarily system are compromised or unavailable. At the network layer, protocols such as the Parallel Redundancy Protocol can be used to simultaneously use redundant and diverse communication over a local network.

If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository.

Serial Communication ports (COM) allow communication with control system devices. Devices can receive command and configuration messages over such serial COM. Devices also use serial COM to send command and reporting messages. Blocking device serial COM may also block command messages and block reporting messages. A serial to Ethernet converter is often connected to a serial COM to facilitate communication between serial and Ethernet devices. One approach to blocking a serial COM would be to create and hold open a TCP session with the Ethernet side of the converter. A serial to Ethernet converter may have a few ports open to facilitate multiple communications. For example, if there are three serial COM available -- 1, 2 and 3 --, the converter might be listening on the corresponding ports 20001, 20002, and 20003. If a TCP/IP connection is opened with one of these ports and held open, then the port will be unavailable for use by another party. One way the adversary could achieve this would be to initiate a TCP session with the serial to Ethernet converter at 10.0.0.1 via Telnet on serial port 1 with the following command: telnet 10.0.0.1 20001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0805\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team overwrote the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware, rendering the devices not operational.

An adversary could potentially instruct a control systems device to perform an action that will cause an Impact.

Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior.

These services allow users to connect to internal network resources from external locations. Examples are VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms. Remote service gateways often manage connections and credential authentication for these services. [1]External remote services allow administration of a control system from outside the system. Often, vendors and internal engineering groups have access to external remote services to control system networks via the corporate network. In some cases, this access is enabled directly from the internet. While remote access enables ease of maintenance when a control system is in a remote area, compromise of remote access solutions is a liability. The adversary may use these services to gain access to and execute attacks against a control system network. Access to valid accounts is often a requirement. As they look for an entry point into the control system network, adversaries may begin searching for existing point-to-point VPN implementations at trusted third party networks or through remote support employee connections where split tunneling is enabled.

Serial Communication ports (COM) allow communication with control system devices. Devices can receive command and configuration messages over such serial COM. Devices also use serial COM to send command and reporting messages. Blocking device serial COM may also block command messages and block reporting messages. A serial to Ethernet converter is often connected to a serial COM to facilitate communication between serial and Ethernet devices. One approach to blocking a serial COM would be to create and hold open a TCP session with the Ethernet side of the converter. A serial to Ethernet converter may have a few ports open to facilitate multiple communications. For example, if there are three serial COM available -- 1, 2 and 3 --, the converter might be listening on the corresponding ports 20001, 20002, and 20003. If a TCP/IP connection is opened with one of these ports and held open, then the port will be unavailable for use by another party. One way the adversary could achieve this would be to initiate a TCP session with the serial to Ethernet converter at 10.0.0.1 via Telnet on serial port 1 with the following command: telnet 10.0.0.1 20001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0805\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team overwrote the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware, rendering the devices not operational.

For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware.

It then searches the logical nodes for the CSW value, which indicates the device performs a circuit breaker or switch control function.[5]Industroyer's OPC DA module also uses IOPCBrowseServerAddressSpace to look for items with the following strings: ctlSelOn, ctlOperOn, ctlSelOff, ctlOperOff, Pos and stVal.[5]Industroyer IEC 60870-5-104 module includes a range mode to discover Information Object Addresses (IOAs) by enumerating through each.[5]\n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 has the capability to poll a target device about its connection status, data transfer status, Common Address (CA), Information Object Addresses (IOAs), and IO state values across multiple priority levels.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet enumerates and parses the System Data Blocks (SDB) using the s7blk_findfirst and s7blk_findnext API calls in s7otbxdx.dll. Stuxnet must find an SDB with the DWORD at offset 50h equal to 0100CB2Ch. This specifies that the system uses the Profibus communications processor module CP 342-5. In addition, specific values are searched for and counted: 7050h and 9500h. 7050h is assigned to part number KFC750V3 which appears to be a frequency converter drive (also known as variable frequency drive) manufactured by Fararo Paya in Teheran, Iran. 9500h is assigned to Vacon NX frequency converter drives manufactured by Vacon based in Finland.[8]Stuxnet was specifically targeting CPUs 6ES7-315-2 (Series 300) with special system data block characteristics for sequence A or B and 6ES7-315-2 for sequence C.

Methods of I/O image manipulation may include overriding the I/O table via direct memory manipulation or using the override function used for testing PLC programs. [1] During the scan cycle, a PLC reads the status of all inputs and stores them in an image table. [2] The image table is the PLCs internal storage location where values of inputs/outputs for one scan are stored while it executes the user program. After the PLC has solved the entire logic program, it updates the output image table. The contents of this output image table are written to the corresponding output points in I/O Modules. One of the unique characteristics of PLCs is their ability to override the status of a physical discrete input or to override the logic driving a physical output coil and force the output to a desired status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0835\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster may manipulate any outputs of the PLC.

Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that control the state of the user program and control access to the controllers API. Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the controllers API. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:  Program - This mode must be enabled before changes can be made to a devices program. This allows program uploads and downloads between the device and an engineering workstation. Often the PLCs logic Is halted, and all outputs may be forced off. [1] Run - Execution of the devices program occurs in this mode. Input and output (values, points, tags, elements, etc.) are monitored and used according to the programs logic. Program Upload and Program Download are disabled while in this mode. [2] [3] [1] [4] Remote - Allows for remote changes to a PLCs operation mode. [4] Stop - The PLC and program is stopped, while in this mode, outputs are forced off. [3] Reset - Conditions on the PLC are reset to their original states. Warm resets may retain some memory while cold resets will reset all I/O and data registers. [3] Test / Monitor mode - Similar to run mode, I/O is processed, although this mode allows for monitoring, force set, resets, and more generally tuning or debugging of the system. Often monitor mode may be used as a trial for initialization.

In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. By blocking these reporting messages, an adversary can potentially hide their actions from an operator.Blocking reporting messages in control systems that manage physical processes may contribute to system impact, causing inhibition of a response function. A control system may not be able to respond in a proper or timely manner to an event, such as a dangerous fault, if its corresponding reporting message is blocked.

These services allow users to connect to internal network resources from external locations. Examples are VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms. Remote service gateways often manage connections and credential authentication for these services. [1]External remote services allow administration of a control system from outside the system. Often, vendors and internal engineering groups have access to external remote services to control system networks via the corporate network. In some cases, this access is enabled directly from the internet. While remote access enables ease of maintenance when a control system is in a remote area, compromise of remote access solutions is a liability. The adversary may use these services to gain access to and execute attacks against a control system network. Access to valid accounts is often a requirement. As they look for an entry point into the control system network, adversaries may begin searching for existing point-to-point VPN implementations at trusted third party networks or through remote support employee connections where split tunneling is enabled.

Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that control the state of the user program and control access to the controllers API. Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the controllers API. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:  Program - This mode must be enabled before changes can be made to a devices program. This allows program uploads and downloads between the device and an engineering workstation. Often the PLCs logic Is halted, and all outputs may be forced off. [1] Run - Execution of the devices program occurs in this mode. Input and output (values, points, tags, elements, etc.) are monitored and used according to the programs logic. Program Upload and Program Download are disabled while in this mode. [2] [3] [1] [4] Remote - Allows for remote changes to a PLCs operation mode. [4] Stop - The PLC and program is stopped, while in this mode, outputs are forced off. [3] Reset - Conditions on the PLC are reset to their original states. Warm resets may retain some memory while cold resets will reset all I/O and data registers. [3] Test / Monitor mode - Similar to run mode, I/O is processed, although this mode allows for monitoring, force set, resets, and more generally tuning or debugging of the system. Often monitor mode may be used as a trial for initialization.

Command messages are used in ICS networks to give direct instructions to control systems devices. If an adversary can send an unauthorized command message to a control system, then it can instruct the control systems device to perform an action outside the normal bounds of the device's actions. An adversary could potentially instruct a control systems device to perform an action that will cause an Impact.

Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment. Some ICS devices are particularly sensitive to DoS events, and may become unresponsive in reaction to even a simple ping sweep. Adversaries may also attempt to execute a Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) against certain devices, such as in the case of the BrickerBot malware. [1] Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to cause a denial of service by taking advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to cause a denial of service condition. Adversaries may have prior knowledge about industrial protocols or control devices used in the environment through Remote System Information Discovery. There are examples of adversaries remotely causing a Device Restart/Shutdown by exploiting a vulnerability that induces uncontrolled resource consumption.

This can result in equipment damage, prolonged process disruptions and hazards to personnel. Many faults and abnormal conditions in process control happen too quickly for a human operator to react to. Speed is critical in correcting these conditions to limit serious impacts such as Loss of Control and Property Damage. Adversaries may target and disable protective system functions as a prerequisite to subsequent attack execution or to allow for future faults and abnormal conditions to go unchecked. Detection of a Loss of Protection by operators can result in the shutdown of a process due to strict policies regarding protection systems. This can cause a Loss of Productivity and Revenue and may meet the technical goals of adversaries seeking to cause process disruptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0837\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa012 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer contained a module which leveraged a vulnerability in the Siemens SIPROTEC relays (CVE-2015-5374) to create a Denial of Service against automated protective relays.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

Adversaries could use these types of relationships to manage command and control communications, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion.

Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific C2 protocol used by a particular adversary or tool and will likely be different across various malware families and versions. Adversaries will likely change tool C2 signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way as to avoid detection by common defensive tools.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors. [1] Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets. The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations. Initial access to the intended targets used watering hole attacks to target process control, ICS, and critical infrastructure related trade publications and informational websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0817\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n G1000 \n\n\n ALLANITE \n\n\nALLANITE leverages watering hole attacks to gain access into electric utilities.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Older device firmware may be factory installed and require special reprograming equipment. When available, the firmware update feature enables vendors to remotely patch bugs and perform upgrades. Device firmware updates are often delegated to the user and may be done using a software update package. It may also be possible to perform this task over the network. An adversary may exploit the firmware update feature on accessible devices to upload malicious or out-of-date firmware. Malicious modification of device firmware may provide an adversary with root access to a device, given firmware is one of the lowest programming abstraction layers.

This can allow an adversary to manipulate the execution flow and behavior of a controller. According to 61131-3, the association of a Task with a Program Organization Unit (POU) defines a task association. [1] An adversary may modify these associations or create new ones to manipulate the execution flow of a controller. Modification of controller tasking can be accomplished using a Program Download in addition to other types of program modification such as online edit and program append.Tasks have properties, such as interval, frequency and priority to meet the requirements of program execution. Some controller vendors implement tasks with implicit, pre-defined properties whereas others allow for these properties to be formulated explicitly. An adversary may associate their program with tasks that have a higher priority or execute associated programs more frequently. For instance, to ensure cyclic execution of their program on a Siemens controller, an adversary may add their program to the task, Organization Block 1 (OB1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0821\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster's code is stored in OB9999.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Examples credentials that may be hardcoded in an asset include:Username/PasswordsCryptographic keys/CertificatesAPI tokensUnlike Default Credentials, these credentials are built into the system in a way that they either cannot be changed by the asset owner, or may be infeasible to change because of the impact it would cause to the control system operation. These credentials may be reused across whole product lines or device models and are often not published or known to the owner and operators of the asset. Adversaries may utilize these hardcoded credentials to move throughout the control system environment or provide reliable access for their tools to interact with industrial assets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0891\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nLateral Movement,                                                        Persistence \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Aagam Shah, @neutrinoguy, ABB\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa029 September 2022\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can login to Omron PLCs using hardcoded credentials, which is documented in CVE-2022-34151.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet uses a hardcoded password in the WinCC software's database server as one of the mechanisms used to propagate to nearby systems.

Older device firmware may be factory installed and require special reprograming equipment. When available, the firmware update feature enables vendors to remotely patch bugs and perform upgrades. Device firmware updates are often delegated to the user and may be done using a software update package. It may also be possible to perform this task over the network. An adversary may exploit the firmware update feature on accessible devices to upload malicious or out-of-date firmware. Malicious modification of device firmware may provide an adversary with root access to a device, given firmware is one of the lowest programming abstraction layers.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Examples credentials that may be hardcoded in an asset include:Username/PasswordsCryptographic keys/CertificatesAPI tokensUnlike Default Credentials, these credentials are built into the system in a way that they either cannot be changed by the asset owner, or may be infeasible to change because of the impact it would cause to the control system operation. These credentials may be reused across whole product lines or device models and are often not published or known to the owner and operators of the asset. Adversaries may utilize these hardcoded credentials to move throughout the control system environment or provide reliable access for their tools to interact with industrial assets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0891\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nLateral Movement,                                                        Persistence \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Aagam Shah, @neutrinoguy, ABB\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa029 September 2022\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can login to Omron PLCs using hardcoded credentials, which is documented in CVE-2022-34151.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet uses a hardcoded password in the WinCC software's database server as one of the mechanisms used to propagate to nearby systems.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way.

[1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence.

Access to a wireless network may be gained through the compromise of a wireless device. [1] [2] Adversaries may also utilize radios and other wireless communication devices on the same frequency as the wireless network. Wireless compromise can be done as an initial access vector from a remote distance. A Polish student used a modified TV remote controller to gain access to and control over the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [3] [4] The remote controller device allowed the student to interface with the trams network to modify track settings and override operator control. The adversary may have accomplished this by aligning the controller to the frequency and amplitude of IR control protocol signals. [5] The controller then enabled initial access to the network, allowing the capture and replay of tram signals.

Normally, transient assets are brought into an environment by authorized personnel and do not remain in that environment on a permanent basis. [1] Transient assets are commonly needed to support management functions and may be more common in systems where a remotely managed asset is not feasible, external connections for remote access do not exist, or 3rd party contractor/vendor access is required. Adversaries may take advantage of transient assets in different ways. For instance, adversaries may target a transient asset when it is connected to an external network and then leverage its trusted access in another environment to launch an attack. They may also take advantage of installed applications and libraries that are used by legitimate end-users to interact with control system devices. Transient assets, in some cases, may not be deployed with a secure configuration leading to weaknesses that could allow an adversary to propagate malicious executable code, e.g., the transient asset may be infected by malware and when connected to an ICS environment the malware propagates onto other systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0864\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa014 October 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0020 \n\n\n Maroochy Water Breach \n\n\nIn the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary utilized a computer, possibly stolen, with proprietary engineering software to communicate with a wastewater system.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeted Assets\n\n\n\nID\nAsset\n\n\n\n\n\n A0001 \n\n\n Workstation \n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\n\n\nID\nMitigation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n M0949 \n\n\n Antivirus/Antimalware \n\n\nInstall anti-virus software on all workstation and transient assets that may have external access, such as to web, email, or remote file shares.\n\n\n\n\n M0947 \n\n\n Audit \n\n\nIntegrity checking of transient assets can include performing the validation of the booted operating system and programs using TPM-based technologies, such as Secure Boot and Trusted Boot.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

User interaction may consist of installing applications, opening email attachments, or granting higher permissions to documents. Adversaries may embed malicious code or visual basic code into files such as Microsoft Word and Excel documents or software installers. [1] Execution of this code requires that the user enable scripting or write access within the document.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

Modification to controller programs can be accomplished using a Program Download in addition to other types of program modification such as online edit and program append. Program modification encompasses the addition and modification of instructions and logic contained in Program Organization Units (POU)  [1] and similar programming elements found on controllers. This can include, for example, adding new functions to a controller, modifying the logic in existing functions and making new calls from one function to another.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Two examples are Windows Sysinternals SDelete and Active@ Killdisk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0809\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Matan Dobrushin - Otorio\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can wipe the memory of Omron PLCs and reset settings through the remote HTTP service.[2][3][4] \n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer has a destructive wiper that overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files.

Older device firmware may be factory installed and require special reprograming equipment. When available, the firmware update feature enables vendors to remotely patch bugs and perform upgrades. Device firmware updates are often delegated to the user and may be done using a software update package. It may also be possible to perform this task over the network. An adversary may exploit the firmware update feature on accessible devices to upload malicious or out-of-date firmware. Malicious modification of device firmware may provide an adversary with root access to a device, given firmware is one of the lowest programming abstraction layers.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems. [1]ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

The adversary may rely on unknowing trusted third parties, such as suppliers or contractors with access privileges, to introduce the removable media. This technique enables initial access to target devices that never connect to untrusted networks, but are physically accessible.     Operators of the German nuclear power plant, Gundremmingen, discovered malware on a facility computer not connected to the internet. [1] [2] The malware included Conficker and W32.Ramnit, which were also found on eighteen removable disk drives in the facility. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The plant has since checked for infection and cleaned up more than 1,000 computers. [9] An ESET researcher commented that internet disconnection does not guarantee system safety from infection or payload execution.

Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment. Some ICS devices are particularly sensitive to DoS events, and may become unresponsive in reaction to even a simple ping sweep. Adversaries may also attempt to execute a Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) against certain devices, such as in the case of the BrickerBot malware. [1] Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to cause a denial of service by taking advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to cause a denial of service condition. Adversaries may have prior knowledge about industrial protocols or control devices used in the environment through Remote System Information Discovery. There are examples of adversaries remotely causing a Device Restart/Shutdown by exploiting a vulnerability that induces uncontrolled resource consumption.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Two examples are Windows Sysinternals SDelete and Active@ Killdisk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0809\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Matan Dobrushin - Otorio\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can wipe the memory of Omron PLCs and reset settings through the remote HTTP service.[2][3][4] \n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer has a destructive wiper that overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files.

Out-of-band communication should utilize diverse systems and technologies to minimize common failure modes and vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure. For example, wireless networks (e.g., 3G, 4G) can be used to provide diverse and redundant delivery of data.\n\n\n\n\n M0811 \n\n\n Redundancy of Service \n\n\nHot-standbys in diverse locations can ensure continued operations if the primarily system are compromised or unavailable.

The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Two examples are Windows Sysinternals SDelete and Active@ Killdisk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0809\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Matan Dobrushin - Otorio\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can wipe the memory of Omron PLCs and reset settings through the remote HTTP service.[2][3][4] \n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer has a destructive wiper that overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files.

Out-of-band communication should utilize diverse systems and technologies to minimize common failure modes and vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure. For example, wireless networks (e.g., 3G, 4G) can be used to provide diverse and redundant delivery of data.\n\n\n\n\n M0811 \n\n\n Redundancy of Service \n\n\nHot-standbys in diverse locations can ensure continued operations if the primarily system are compromised or unavailable. At the network layer, protocols such as the Parallel Redundancy Protocol can be used to simultaneously use redundant and diverse communication over a local network.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

Modification to controller programs can be accomplished using a Program Download in addition to other types of program modification such as online edit and program append. Program modification encompasses the addition and modification of instructions and logic contained in Program Organization Units (POU)  [1] and similar programming elements found on controllers. This can include, for example, adding new functions to a controller, modifying the logic in existing functions and making new calls from one function to another. Some programs may allow an adversary to interact directly with the native API of the controller to take advantage of obscure features or vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0889\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nPersistence \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa020 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster copies itself to various Program Organization Units (POU) on the target device.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

During the scan cycle, a PLC reads the status of all inputs and stores them in an image table. [1] The image table is the PLCs internal storage location where values of inputs/outputs for one scan are stored while it executes the user program. After the PLC has solved the entire logic program, it updates the output image table. The contents of this output image table are written to the corresponding output points in I/O Modules.The Input and Output Image tables described above make up the I/O Image on a PLC. This image is used by the user program instead of directly interacting with physical I/O. [2] Adversaries may collect the I/O Image state of a PLC by utilizing a devices Native API to access the memory regions directly. The collection of the PLCs I/O state could be used to replace values or inform future stages of an attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0877\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nCollection \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet copies the input area of an I/O image into data blocks with a one second interval between copies, forming a 21 second recording of the input area.

The adversary may rely on unknowing trusted third parties, such as suppliers or contractors with access privileges, to introduce the removable media. This technique enables initial access to target devices that never connect to untrusted networks, but are physically accessible.     Operators of the German nuclear power plant, Gundremmingen, discovered malware on a facility computer not connected to the internet. [1] [2] The malware included Conficker and W32.Ramnit, which were also found on eighteen removable disk drives in the facility. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The plant has since checked for infection and cleaned up more than 1,000 computers. [9] An ESET researcher commented that internet disconnection does not guarantee system safety from infection or payload execution.

This can result in equipment damage, prolonged process disruptions and hazards to personnel. Many faults and abnormal conditions in process control happen too quickly for a human operator to react to. Speed is critical in correcting these conditions to limit serious impacts such as Loss of Control and Property Damage. Adversaries may target and disable protective system functions as a prerequisite to subsequent attack execution or to allow for future faults and abnormal conditions to go unchecked. Detection of a Loss of Protection by operators can result in the shutdown of a process due to strict policies regarding protection systems. This can cause a Loss of Productivity and Revenue and may meet the technical goals of adversaries seeking to cause process disruptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0837\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpact \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa012 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer contained a module which leveraged a vulnerability in the Siemens SIPROTEC relays (CVE-2015-5374) to create a Denial of Service against automated protective relays.

During the scan cycle, a PLC reads the status of all inputs and stores them in an image table. [1] The image table is the PLCs internal storage location where values of inputs/outputs for one scan are stored while it executes the user program. After the PLC has solved the entire logic program, it updates the output image table. The contents of this output image table are written to the corresponding output points in I/O Modules.The Input and Output Image tables described above make up the I/O Image on a PLC. This image is used by the user program instead of directly interacting with physical I/O. [2] Adversaries may collect the I/O Image state of a PLC by utilizing a devices Native API to access the memory regions directly. The collection of the PLCs I/O state could be used to replace values or inform future stages of an attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0877\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nCollection \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet copies the input area of an I/O image into data blocks with a one second interval between copies, forming a 21 second recording of the input area.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

User interaction may consist of installing applications, opening email attachments, or granting higher permissions to documents. Adversaries may embed malicious code or visual basic code into files such as Microsoft Word and Excel documents or software installers. [1] Execution of this code requires that the user enable scripting or write access within the document. Embedded code may not always be noticeable to the user especially in cases of trojanized software.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting and modifying operating-system API calls that supply system information. Rootkits or rootkit-enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system, or lower. [1] Firmware rootkits that affect the operating system yield nearly full control of the system. While firmware rootkits are normally developed for the main processing board, they can also be developed for the I/O that is attached to an asset. Compromise of this firmware allows the modification of all of the process variables and functions the module engages in. This may result in commands being disregarded and false information being fed to the main device. By tampering with device processes, an adversary may inhibit its expected response functions and possibly enable Impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0851\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nEvasion,                                                        Inhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nOne of Stuxnet's rootkits is contained entirely in the fake s7otbxdx.dll.

User interaction may consist of installing applications, opening email attachments, or granting higher permissions to documents. Adversaries may embed malicious code or visual basic code into files such as Microsoft Word and Excel documents or software installers. [1] Execution of this code requires that the user enable scripting or write access within the document. Embedded code may not always be noticeable to the user especially in cases of trojanized software. [2] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012 delivered malware through spearphishing attachments which required user action to achieve execution.

This can allow an adversary to manipulate the execution flow and behavior of a controller. According to 61131-3, the association of a Task with a Program Organization Unit (POU) defines a task association. [1] An adversary may modify these associations or create new ones to manipulate the execution flow of a controller. Modification of controller tasking can be accomplished using a Program Download in addition to other types of program modification such as online edit and program append.Tasks have properties, such as interval, frequency and priority to meet the requirements of program execution. Some controller vendors implement tasks with implicit, pre-defined properties whereas others allow for these properties to be formulated explicitly. An adversary may associate their program with tasks that have a higher priority or execute associated programs more frequently. For instance, to ensure cyclic execution of their program on a Siemens controller, an adversary may add their program to the task, Organization Block 1 (OB1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0821\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster's code is stored in OB9999.

These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters. Such parameters can determine the extent to which an action is performed and may specify additional options. For example, a program on a control system device dictating motor processes may take a parameter defining the total number of seconds to run that motor.      An adversary can potentially modify these parameters to produce an outcome outside of what was intended by the operators. By modifying system and process critical parameters, the adversary may cause Impact to equipment and/or control processes. Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations. For example, specifying that a process run for more or less time than it should, or dictating an unusually high, low, or invalid value as a parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0836\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpair Process Control \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.3\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the HTTP CGI scripts on Omron PLCs to modify parameters on EtherCat connected servo drives.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 modifies specified Information Object Addresses (IOAs) for specified Application Service Data Unit (ASDU) addresses to either the ON or OFF state.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n C0020 \n\n\n Maroochy Water Breach \n\n\nIn the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way.

Modification to controller programs can be accomplished using a Program Download in addition to other types of program modification such as online edit and program append. Program modification encompasses the addition and modification of instructions and logic contained in Program Organization Units (POU)  [1] and similar programming elements found on controllers. This can include, for example, adding new functions to a controller, modifying the logic in existing functions and making new calls from one function to another. Some programs may allow an adversary to interact directly with the native API of the controller to take advantage of obscure features or vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0889\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nPersistence \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa020 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster copies itself to various Program Organization Units (POU) on the target device.

Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that control the state of the user program and control access to the controllers API. Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the controllers API. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:  Program - This mode must be enabled before changes can be made to a devices program. This allows program uploads and downloads between the device and an engineering workstation. Often the PLCs logic Is halted, and all outputs may be forced off. [1] Run - Execution of the devices program occurs in this mode. Input and output (values, points, tags, elements, etc.) are monitored and used according to the programs logic. Program Upload and Program Download are disabled while in this mode. [2] [3] [1] [4] Remote - Allows for remote changes to a PLCs operation mode. [4] Stop - The PLC and program is stopped, while in this mode, outputs are forced off. [3] Reset - Conditions on the PLC are reset to their original states. Warm resets may retain some memory while cold resets will reset all I/O and data registers. [3] Test / Monitor mode - Similar to run mode, I/O is processed, although this mode allows for monitoring, force set, resets, and more generally tuning or debugging of the system. Often monitor mode may be used as a trial for initialization.

Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting and modifying operating-system API calls that supply system information. Rootkits or rootkit-enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system, or lower. [1] Firmware rootkits that affect the operating system yield nearly full control of the system. While firmware rootkits are normally developed for the main processing board, they can also be developed for the I/O that is attached to an asset. Compromise of this firmware allows the modification of all of the process variables and functions the module engages in. This may result in commands being disregarded and false information being fed to the main device. By tampering with device processes, an adversary may inhibit its expected response functions and possibly enable Impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0851\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nEvasion,                                                        Inhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nOne of Stuxnet's rootkits is contained entirely in the fake s7otbxdx.dll.

Some programs may allow an adversary to interact directly with the native API of the controller to take advantage of obscure features or vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0889\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nPersistence \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa020 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster copies itself to various Program Organization Units (POU) on the target device.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that control the state of the user program and control access to the controllers API. Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the controllers API. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:  Program - This mode must be enabled before changes can be made to a devices program. This allows program uploads and downloads between the device and an engineering workstation. Often the PLCs logic Is halted, and all outputs may be forced off. [1] Run - Execution of the devices program occurs in this mode. Input and output (values, points, tags, elements, etc.) are monitored and used according to the programs logic. Program Upload and Program Download are disabled while in this mode. [2] [3] [1] [4] Remote - Allows for remote changes to a PLCs operation mode. [4] Stop - The PLC and program is stopped, while in this mode, outputs are forced off. [3] Reset - Conditions on the PLC are reset to their original states. Warm resets may retain some memory while cold resets will reset all I/O and data registers. [3] Test / Monitor mode - Similar to run mode, I/O is processed, although this mode allows for monitoring, force set, resets, and more generally tuning or debugging of the system. Often monitor mode may be used as a trial for initialization.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

It then searches the logical nodes for the CSW value, which indicates the device performs a circuit breaker or switch control function.[5]Industroyer's OPC DA module also uses IOPCBrowseServerAddressSpace to look for items with the following strings: ctlSelOn, ctlOperOn, ctlSelOff, ctlOperOff, Pos and stVal.[5]Industroyer IEC 60870-5-104 module includes a range mode to discover Information Object Addresses (IOAs) by enumerating through each.[5]\n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 has the capability to poll a target device about its connection status, data transfer status, Common Address (CA), Information Object Addresses (IOAs), and IO state values across multiple priority levels.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet enumerates and parses the System Data Blocks (SDB) using the s7blk_findfirst and s7blk_findnext API calls in s7otbxdx.dll. Stuxnet must find an SDB with the DWORD at offset 50h equal to 0100CB2Ch. This specifies that the system uses the Profibus communications processor module CP 342-5. In addition, specific values are searched for and counted: 7050h and 9500h. 7050h is assigned to part number KFC750V3 which appears to be a frequency converter drive (also known as variable frequency drive) manufactured by Fararo Paya in Teheran, Iran. 9500h is assigned to Vacon NX frequency converter drives manufactured by Vacon based in Finland.[8]Stuxnet was specifically targeting CPUs 6ES7-315-2 (Series 300) with special system data block characteristics for sequence A or B and 6ES7-315-2 for sequence C.

Command messages are used in ICS networks to give direct instructions to control systems devices. If an adversary can send an unauthorized command message to a control system, then it can instruct the control systems device to perform an action outside the normal bounds of the device's actions. An adversary could potentially instruct a control systems device to perform an action that will cause an Impact.

This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in Loss of Safety. Operations that result in Loss of Control may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of Loss of Productivity and Revenue. The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report. [1]  These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace. A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [2] [3] [4] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. This resulted in damage to impacted trams, people, and the surrounding property. Reportedly, four trams were derailed and were forced to make emergency stops. [3] Commands issued by the student may have also resulted in tram collisions, causing harm to those on board and the environment outside.

Normally, transient assets are brought into an environment by authorized personnel and do not remain in that environment on a permanent basis. [1] Transient assets are commonly needed to support management functions and may be more common in systems where a remotely managed asset is not feasible, external connections for remote access do not exist, or 3rd party contractor/vendor access is required. Adversaries may take advantage of transient assets in different ways. For instance, adversaries may target a transient asset when it is connected to an external network and then leverage its trusted access in another environment to launch an attack. They may also take advantage of installed applications and libraries that are used by legitimate end-users to interact with control system devices. Transient assets, in some cases, may not be deployed with a secure configuration leading to weaknesses that could allow an adversary to propagate malicious executable code, e.g., the transient asset may be infected by malware and when connected to an ICS environment the malware propagates onto other systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0864\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa014 October 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0020 \n\n\n Maroochy Water Breach \n\n\nIn the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary utilized a computer, possibly stolen, with proprietary engineering software to communicate with a wastewater system.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeted Assets\n\n\n\nID\nAsset\n\n\n\n\n\n A0001 \n\n\n Workstation \n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\n\n\nID\nMitigation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n M0949 \n\n\n Antivirus/Antimalware \n\n\nInstall anti-virus software on all workstation and transient assets that may have external access, such as to web, email, or remote file shares.\n\n\n\n\n M0947 \n\n\n Audit \n\n\nIntegrity checking of transient assets can include performing the validation of the booted operating system and programs using TPM-based technologies, such as Secure Boot and Trusted Boot.

For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware.

Methods of I/O image manipulation may include overriding the I/O table via direct memory manipulation or using the override function used for testing PLC programs. [1] During the scan cycle, a PLC reads the status of all inputs and stores them in an image table. [2] The image table is the PLCs internal storage location where values of inputs/outputs for one scan are stored while it executes the user program. After the PLC has solved the entire logic program, it updates the output image table. The contents of this output image table are written to the corresponding output points in I/O Modules. One of the unique characteristics of PLCs is their ability to override the status of a physical discrete input or to override the logic driving a physical output coil and force the output to a desired status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0835\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster may manipulate any outputs of the PLC.

Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that control the state of the user program and control access to the controllers API. Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the controllers API. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:  Program - This mode must be enabled before changes can be made to a devices program. This allows program uploads and downloads between the device and an engineering workstation. Often the PLCs logic Is halted, and all outputs may be forced off. [1] Run - Execution of the devices program occurs in this mode. Input and output (values, points, tags, elements, etc.) are monitored and used according to the programs logic. Program Upload and Program Download are disabled while in this mode. [2] [3] [1] [4] Remote - Allows for remote changes to a PLCs operation mode. [4] Stop - The PLC and program is stopped, while in this mode, outputs are forced off. [3] Reset - Conditions on the PLC are reset to their original states. Warm resets may retain some memory while cold resets will reset all I/O and data registers.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland.

As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

It then searches the logical nodes for the CSW value, which indicates the device performs a circuit breaker or switch control function.[5]Industroyer's OPC DA module also uses IOPCBrowseServerAddressSpace to look for items with the following strings: ctlSelOn, ctlOperOn, ctlSelOff, ctlOperOff, Pos and stVal.[5]Industroyer IEC 60870-5-104 module includes a range mode to discover Information Object Addresses (IOAs) by enumerating through each.[5]\n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 has the capability to poll a target device about its connection status, data transfer status, Common Address (CA), Information Object Addresses (IOAs), and IO state values across multiple priority levels.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet enumerates and parses the System Data Blocks (SDB) using the s7blk_findfirst and s7blk_findnext API calls in s7otbxdx.dll. Stuxnet must find an SDB with the DWORD at offset 50h equal to 0100CB2Ch. This specifies that the system uses the Profibus communications processor module CP 342-5. In addition, specific values are searched for and counted: 7050h and 9500h. 7050h is assigned to part number KFC750V3 which appears to be a frequency converter drive (also known as variable frequency drive) manufactured by Fararo Paya in Teheran, Iran. 9500h is assigned to Vacon NX frequency converter drives manufactured by Vacon based in Finland.[8]Stuxnet was specifically targeting CPUs 6ES7-315-2 (Series 300) with special system data block characteristics for sequence A or B and 6ES7-315-2 for sequence C.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

It then searches the logical nodes for the CSW value, which indicates the device performs a circuit breaker or switch control function.[5]Industroyer's OPC DA module also uses IOPCBrowseServerAddressSpace to look for items with the following strings: ctlSelOn, ctlOperOn, ctlSelOff, ctlOperOff, Pos and stVal.[5]Industroyer IEC 60870-5-104 module includes a range mode to discover Information Object Addresses (IOAs) by enumerating through each.[5]\n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 has the capability to poll a target device about its connection status, data transfer status, Common Address (CA), Information Object Addresses (IOAs), and IO state values across multiple priority levels.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet enumerates and parses the System Data Blocks (SDB) using the s7blk_findfirst and s7blk_findnext API calls in s7otbxdx.dll. Stuxnet must find an SDB with the DWORD at offset 50h equal to 0100CB2Ch. This specifies that the system uses the Profibus communications processor module CP 342-5. In addition, specific values are searched for and counted: 7050h and 9500h. 7050h is assigned to part number KFC750V3 which appears to be a frequency converter drive (also known as variable frequency drive) manufactured by Fararo Paya in Teheran, Iran. 9500h is assigned to Vacon NX frequency converter drives manufactured by Vacon based in Finland.[8]Stuxnet was specifically targeting CPUs 6ES7-315-2 (Series 300) with special system data block characteristics for sequence A or B and 6ES7-315-2 for sequence C.

These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters. Such parameters can determine the extent to which an action is performed and may specify additional options. For example, a program on a control system device dictating motor processes may take a parameter defining the total number of seconds to run that motor.      An adversary can potentially modify these parameters to produce an outcome outside of what was intended by the operators. By modifying system and process critical parameters, the adversary may cause Impact to equipment and/or control processes. Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations. For example, specifying that a process run for more or less time than it should, or dictating an unusually high, low, or invalid value as a parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0836\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpair Process Control \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.3\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the HTTP CGI scripts on Omron PLCs to modify parameters on EtherCat connected servo drives.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 modifies specified Information Object Addresses (IOAs) for specified Application Service Data Unit (ASDU) addresses to either the ON or OFF state.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n C0020 \n\n\n Maroochy Water Breach \n\n\nIn the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way.

Older device firmware may be factory installed and require special reprograming equipment. When available, the firmware update feature enables vendors to remotely patch bugs and perform upgrades. Device firmware updates are often delegated to the user and may be done using a software update package. It may also be possible to perform this task over the network. An adversary may exploit the firmware update feature on accessible devices to upload malicious or out-of-date firmware. Malicious modification of device firmware may provide an adversary with root access to a device, given firmware is one of the lowest programming abstraction layers.

This can allow an adversary to manipulate the execution flow and behavior of a controller. According to 61131-3, the association of a Task with a Program Organization Unit (POU) defines a task association. [1] An adversary may modify these associations or create new ones to manipulate the execution flow of a controller. Modification of controller tasking can be accomplished using a Program Download in addition to other types of program modification such as online edit and program append.Tasks have properties, such as interval, frequency and priority to meet the requirements of program execution. Some controller vendors implement tasks with implicit, pre-defined properties whereas others allow for these properties to be formulated explicitly. An adversary may associate their program with tasks that have a higher priority or execute associated programs more frequently. For instance, to ensure cyclic execution of their program on a Siemens controller, an adversary may add their program to the task, Organization Block 1 (OB1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0821\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.2\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster's code is stored in OB9999.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

Serial Communication ports (COM) allow communication with control system devices. Devices can receive command and configuration messages over such serial COM. Devices also use serial COM to send command and reporting messages. Blocking device serial COM may also block command messages and block reporting messages. A serial to Ethernet converter is often connected to a serial COM to facilitate communication between serial and Ethernet devices. One approach to blocking a serial COM would be to create and hold open a TCP session with the Ethernet side of the converter. A serial to Ethernet converter may have a few ports open to facilitate multiple communications. For example, if there are three serial COM available -- 1, 2 and 3 --, the converter might be listening on the corresponding ports 20001, 20002, and 20003. If a TCP/IP connection is opened with one of these ports and held open, then the port will be unavailable for use by another party. One way the adversary could achieve this would be to initiate a TCP session with the serial to Ethernet converter at 10.0.0.1 via Telnet on serial port 1 with the following command: telnet 10.0.0.1 20001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0805\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team overwrote the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware, rendering the devices not operational.

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions. [1] When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

It is used to receive network frames on the Profibus  a standard industrial network bus used for distributed I/O. The original block is copied to FC1869, and then replaced by a malicious block. Each time the function is used to receive a packet, the malicious Stuxnet block takes control: it will call the original DP_RECV in FC1869 and then perform postprocessing on the packet data.

These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters. Such parameters can determine the extent to which an action is performed and may specify additional options. For example, a program on a control system device dictating motor processes may take a parameter defining the total number of seconds to run that motor.      An adversary can potentially modify these parameters to produce an outcome outside of what was intended by the operators. By modifying system and process critical parameters, the adversary may cause Impact to equipment and/or control processes. Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations. For example, specifying that a process run for more or less time than it should, or dictating an unusually high, low, or invalid value as a parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0836\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpair Process Control \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.3\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the HTTP CGI scripts on Omron PLCs to modify parameters on EtherCat connected servo drives.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 modifies specified Information Object Addresses (IOAs) for specified Application Service Data Unit (ASDU) addresses to either the ON or OFF state.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n C0020 \n\n\n Maroochy Water Breach \n\n\nIn the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way.

[1] This type of attack allows the adversary to intercept traffic to and/or from a particular device on the network. If a AiTM attack is established, then the adversary has the ability to block, log, modify, or inject traffic into the communication stream. There are several ways to accomplish this attack, but some of the most-common are Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning and the use of a proxy. [2] An AiTM attack may allow an adversary to perform the following attacks:Block Reporting Message, Spoof Reporting Message, Modify Parameter, Unauthorized Command Message\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0830\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nCollection \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Conrad Layne - GE Digital\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa02.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1010 \n\n\n VPNFilter \n\n\nThe VPNFilter's ssler module configures the device's iptables to redirect all traffic destined for port 80 to its local service listening on port 8888.

These services allow users to connect to internal network resources from external locations. Examples are VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms. Remote service gateways often manage connections and credential authentication for these services. [1]External remote services allow administration of a control system from outside the system. Often, vendors and internal engineering groups have access to external remote services to control system networks via the corporate network. In some cases, this access is enabled directly from the internet. While remote access enables ease of maintenance when a control system is in a remote area, compromise of remote access solutions is a liability. The adversary may use these services to gain access to and execute attacks against a control system network. Access to valid accounts is often a requirement. As they look for an entry point into the control system network, adversaries may begin searching for existing point-to-point VPN implementations at trusted third party networks or through remote support employee connections where split tunneling is enabled.

For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that control the state of the user program and control access to the controllers API. Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the controllers API. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:  Program - This mode must be enabled before changes can be made to a devices program. This allows program uploads and downloads between the device and an engineering workstation. Often the PLCs logic Is halted, and all outputs may be forced off. [1] Run - Execution of the devices program occurs in this mode. Input and output (values, points, tags, elements, etc.) are monitored and used according to the programs logic. Program Upload and Program Download are disabled while in this mode. [2] [3] [1] [4] Remote - Allows for remote changes to a PLCs operation mode. [4] Stop - The PLC and program is stopped, while in this mode, outputs are forced off. [3] Reset - Conditions on the PLC are reset to their original states. Warm resets may retain some memory while cold resets will reset all I/O and data registers. [3] Test / Monitor mode - Similar to run mode, I/O is processed, although this mode allows for monitoring, force set, resets, and more generally tuning or debugging of the system. Often monitor mode may be used as a trial for initialization.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

User interaction may consist of installing applications, opening email attachments, or granting higher permissions to documents. Adversaries may embed malicious code or visual basic code into files such as Microsoft Word and Excel documents or software installers. [1] Execution of this code requires that the user enable scripting or write access within the document. Embedded code may not always be noticeable to the user especially in cases of trojanized software. [2] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012 delivered malware through spearphishing attachments which required user action to achieve execution.

The adversary may rely on unknowing trusted third parties, such as suppliers or contractors with access privileges, to introduce the removable media. This technique enables initial access to target devices that never connect to untrusted networks, but are physically accessible.     Operators of the German nuclear power plant, Gundremmingen, discovered malware on a facility computer not connected to the internet. [1] [2] The malware included Conficker and W32.Ramnit, which were also found on eighteen removable disk drives in the facility. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The plant has since checked for infection and cleaned up more than 1,000 computers. [9] An ESET researcher commented that internet disconnection does not guarantee system safety from infection or payload execution.

Once it has infected a computer, Conficker automatically copies itself to all visible open drive shares on other computers inside the network.

A willing insider or unknown third party, such as a contractor, may have brought the removable media into the target environment.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

[8] [9]\n\n\n\n\n M0913 \n\n\n Application Developer Guidance \n\n\nEnsure that applications and devices do not store sensitive data or credentials insecurely (e.g., plaintext credentials in code, published credentials in repositories, or credentials in public cloud storage). [10]\n\n\n\n\n M0947 \n\n\n Audit \n\n\nRoutinely audit source code, application configuration files, open repositories, and public cloud storage for insecure use and storage of credentials.\n\n\n\n\n M0937 \n\n\n Filter Network Traffic \n\n\nConsider using IP allowlisting along with user account management to ensure that data access is restricted not only to valid users but only from expected IP ranges to mitigate the use of stolen credentials to access data.\n\n\n\n\n M0932 \n\n\n Multi-factor Authentication \n\n\nIntegrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining access to valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to cloud resources and APIs.\n\n\n\n\n M0927 \n\n\n Password Policies \n\n\nApplications and appliances that utilize default username and password should be changed immediately after the installation, and before deployment to a production environment. [10]\n\n\n\n\n M0926 \n\n\n Privileged Account Management \n\n\nAudit domain and local accounts and their permission levels routinely to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain system wide access with stolen privileged account credentials. [11] [12]These audits should also identify if default accounts have been enabled, or if new local accounts are created that have not be authorized. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers. [13]\n\n\n\n\n M0918 \n\n\n User Account Management \n\n\nEnsure users and user groups have appropriate permissions for their roles through Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls. Implement strict IAM controls to prevent access to systems except for the applications, users, and services that require access. Implement user accounts for each individual for enforcement and non-repudiation of actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection\n\n\n\n\nID\nData Source\nData Component\nDetects\n\n\n\n\n\nDS0028\n\n\nLogon Session\n\n\n\nLogon Session Creation\n\n\nMonitor for logon behavior that may abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Lateral Movement or Persistence. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogon Session Metadata\n\n\nMonitor for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account.\n\n\n\n\nDS0002\n\n\nUser Account\n\n\n\nUser Account Authentication\n\n\nMonitor for an authentication attempt by a user that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Booz Allen Hamilton   When The Lights Went Out Retrieved. 2019/10/22 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center; SANS Industrial Control Systems.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

Command messages are used in ICS networks to give direct instructions to control systems devices. If an adversary can send an unauthorized command message to a control system, then it can instruct the control systems device to perform an action outside the normal bounds of the device's actions. An adversary could potentially instruct a control systems device to perform an action that will cause an Impact.

These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters. Such parameters can determine the extent to which an action is performed and may specify additional options. For example, a program on a control system device dictating motor processes may take a parameter defining the total number of seconds to run that motor.      An adversary can potentially modify these parameters to produce an outcome outside of what was intended by the operators. By modifying system and process critical parameters, the adversary may cause Impact to equipment and/or control processes. Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations. For example, specifying that a process run for more or less time than it should, or dictating an unusually high, low, or invalid value as a parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0836\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpair Process Control \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.3\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the HTTP CGI scripts on Omron PLCs to modify parameters on EtherCat connected servo drives.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 modifies specified Information Object Addresses (IOAs) for specified Application Service Data Unit (ASDU) addresses to either the ON or OFF state.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n C0020 \n\n\n Maroochy Water Breach \n\n\nIn the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

The adversary may rely on unknowing trusted third parties, such as suppliers or contractors with access privileges, to introduce the removable media. This technique enables initial access to target devices that never connect to untrusted networks, but are physically accessible.     Operators of the German nuclear power plant, Gundremmingen, discovered malware on a facility computer not connected to the internet. [1] [2] The malware included Conficker and W32.Ramnit, which were also found on eighteen removable disk drives in the facility. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The plant has since checked for infection and cleaned up more than 1,000 computers. [9] An ESET researcher commented that internet disconnection does not guarantee system safety from infection or payload execution.

In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. Reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system or identifying important events such as deviations from expected values. If an adversary has the ability to Spoof Reporting Messages, they can impact the control system in many ways. The adversary can Spoof Reporting Messages that state that the process is operating normally, as a form of evasion. The adversary could also Spoof Reporting Messages to make the defenders and operators think that other errors are occurring in order to distract them from the actual source of a problem.

The rootkit modifies these requests so that Stuxnets PLC code is not discovered or damaged. >>, what MITRE ATT&CK ICS tactics will a cyber adversary achieve with this technique?",Persistence,"[Document(page_content='Masquerading, Technique T0849 - ICS | MITRE ATT&CK®\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrices\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nTactics\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nTechniques\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\n\n\nDefenses\n\n\nData Sources\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\nEnterprise\nMobile\nICS\n\n\nAssets\n\n\n\n\nCTI\n\n\nGroups\nSoftware\nCampaigns\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nGeneral Information\nGetting Started\nContribute\nTraining\nATT&CKcon\nWorking with ATT&CK\nFAQ\nUpdates\nVersions of ATT&CK\nRelated Projects\nBrand Guide\n\n\n\nBenefactors\n\n\n\nBlog\xa0\n        \n\n\n\nSearch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        ATT&CK v14 has been released!

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

Modification to controller programs can be accomplished using a Program Download in addition to other types of program modification such as online edit and program append. Program modification encompasses the addition and modification of instructions and logic contained in Program Organization Units (POU)  [1] and similar programming elements found on controllers. This can include, for example, adding new functions to a controller, modifying the logic in existing functions and making new calls from one function to another.

All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors. [1] Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets. The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations. Initial access to the intended targets used watering hole attacks to target process control, ICS, and critical infrastructure related trade publications and informational websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0817\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n G1000 \n\n\n ALLANITE \n\n\nALLANITE leverages watering hole attacks to gain access into electric utilities.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

User interaction may consist of installing applications, opening email attachments, or granting higher permissions to documents. Adversaries may embed malicious code or visual basic code into files such as Microsoft Word and Excel documents or software installers. [1] Execution of this code requires that the user enable scripting or write access within the document. Embedded code may not always be noticeable to the user especially in cases of trojanized software. [2] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012 delivered malware through spearphishing attachments which required user action to achieve execution.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. [1]Data destruction may also be used to render operator interfaces unable to respond and to disrupt response functions from occurring as expected. An adversary may also destroy data backups that are vital to recovery after an incident.Standard file deletion commands are available on most operating system and device interfaces to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Two examples are Windows Sysinternals SDelete and Active@ Killdisk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0809\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInhibit Response Function \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nContributors:\xa0Matan Dobrushin - Otorio\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can wipe the memory of Omron PLCs and reset settings through the remote HTTP service.[2][3][4] \n\n\n\n\n S0604 \n\n\n Industroyer \n\n\nIndustroyer has a destructive wiper that overwrites all ICS configuration files across the hard drives and all mapped network drives specifically targeting ABB PCM600 configuration files.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors. [1] Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets. The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations. Initial access to the intended targets used watering hole attacks to target process control, ICS, and critical infrastructure related trade publications and informational websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0817\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n G1000 \n\n\n ALLANITE \n\n\nALLANITE leverages watering hole attacks to gain access into electric utilities.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors. [1] Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets. The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations. Initial access to the intended targets used watering hole attacks to target process control, ICS, and critical infrastructure related trade publications and informational websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0817\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n G1000 \n\n\n ALLANITE \n\n\nALLANITE leverages watering hole attacks to gain access into electric utilities.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment. Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0853\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nExecution \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team utilized VBS and batch scripts for file movement and as wrappers for PowerShell execution.[1]\n\n\n\n\n G0064 \n\n\n APT33 \n\n\nAPT33 utilized PowerShell scripts to establish command and control and install files for execution.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

Windows processes often leverage these API functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions. [1]One type of hooking seen in ICS involves redirecting calls to these functions via import address table (IAT) hooking. IAT hooking uses modifications to a process IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored.

Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions. Applications and other files commonly found on Windows systems or in engineering workstations have been impersonated before. This can be as simple as renaming a file to effectively disguise it in the ICS environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0849\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nEvasion \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0025 \n\n\n 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team transferred executable files as .txt and then renamed them to .exe, likely to avoid detection through extension tracking.[1]\n\n\n\n\n S0605 \n\n\n EKANS \n\n\nEKANS masquerades itself as a valid executable with the filename update.exe.

In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. Reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system or identifying important events such as deviations from expected values. If an adversary has the ability to Spoof Reporting Messages, they can impact the control system in many ways. The adversary can Spoof Reporting Messages that state that the process is operating normally, as a form of evasion. The adversary could also Spoof Reporting Messages to make the defenders and operators think that other errors are occurring in order to distract them from the actual source of a problem.

A rogue master can be used to send legitimate control messages to other control system devices, affecting processes in unintended ways. It may also be used to disrupt network communications by capturing and receiving the network traffic meant for the actual master. Impersonating a master may also allow an adversary to avoid detection. In the case of the 2017 Dallas Siren incident, adversaries used a rogue master to send command messages to the 156 distributed sirens across the city, either through a single rogue transmitter with a strong signal, or using many distributed repeaters.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors. [1] Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets. The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations. Initial access to the intended targets used watering hole attacks to target process control, ICS, and critical infrastructure related trade publications and informational websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0817\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n G1000 \n\n\n ALLANITE \n\n\nALLANITE leverages watering hole attacks to gain access into electric utilities.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Correlation of other events with behavior surrounding API function calls using API monitoring will provide additional context to an event that may assist in determining if it is due to malicious behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Jos Wetzels 2018, January 16 Analyzing the TRITON industrial malware Retrieved. 2019/10/22 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        McCarthy, J et al. 2018, July NIST SP 1800-2 Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities Retrieved. 2020/09/17 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        MITRE 2020, June CWE CATEGORY: 7PK - API Abuse Retrieved. 2020/09/25 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nload more results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 Â© 2015-2023, The MITRE Corporation.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors. [1] Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets. The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations.

This can include sensitive data such as specifications, schematics, or diagrams of control system layouts, devices, and processes. Examples of information repositories include reference databases in the process environment, as well as databases in the corporate network that might contain information about the ICS.[1]Information collected from these systems may provide the adversary with a better understanding of the operational environment, vendors used, processes, or procedures of the ICS.In a campaign between 2011 and 2013 against ONG organizations, Chinese state-sponsored actors searched document repositories for specific information such as, system manuals, remote terminal unit (RTU) sites, personnel lists, documents that included the string SCAD*, user credentials, and remote dial-up access information.

Information repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use can be non-trivial. At minimum, access to information repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user-based anomalies.\n\n\n\n\nDS0028\n\n\nLogon Session', metadata={'source': 'https://attack.mitre.org//techniques/T0811', 'title': 'Data from Information Repositories, Technique T0811 - ICS | MITRE ATT&CK®', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='References\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        ESET   ACAD/Medre.A: 10000s of AutoCAD Designs Leaked in Suspected Industrial Espionage Retrieved. 2021/04/13 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Symantec   W32.Duqu The precursor to the next Stuxnet Retrieved. 2019/11/03 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Kevin Savage and Branko Spasojevic   W32.Flamer Retrieved. 2019/11/03 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Keith Stouffer 2015, May Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security Retrieved. 2018/03/28 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        National Institute of Standards and Technology 2013, April Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations Retrieved. 2020/09/17 \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nload more results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 Â© 2015-2023, The MITRE Corporation.

This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments. In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences. A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems. [1] The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack. [1] [2] In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in Loss of Safety. Operations that result in Loss of Control may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of Loss of Productivity and Revenue. The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report. [1]  These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations. As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace. A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [2] [3] [4] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. This resulted in damage to impacted trams, people, and the surrounding property. Reportedly, four trams were derailed and were forced to make emergency stops. [3] Commands issued by the student may have also resulted in tram collisions, causing harm to those on board and the environment outside.

These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters. Such parameters can determine the extent to which an action is performed and may specify additional options. For example, a program on a control system device dictating motor processes may take a parameter defining the total number of seconds to run that motor.      An adversary can potentially modify these parameters to produce an outcome outside of what was intended by the operators. By modifying system and process critical parameters, the adversary may cause Impact to equipment and/or control processes. Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations. For example, specifying that a process run for more or less time than it should, or dictating an unusually high, low, or invalid value as a parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0836\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nImpair Process Control \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.3\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the HTTP CGI scripts on Omron PLCs to modify parameters on EtherCat connected servo drives.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 modifies specified Information Object Addresses (IOAs) for specified Application Service Data Unit (ASDU) addresses to either the ON or OFF state.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n C0020 \n\n\n Maroochy Water Breach \n\n\nIn the Maroochy Water Breach, the adversary gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way.

Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control. However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state. This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action. Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process. An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API. Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space.  Modify Controller Tasking and Modify Program represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0843\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nLateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S1045 \n\n\n INCONTROLLER \n\n\nINCONTROLLER can use the CODESYS protocol to download programs to Schneider PLCs.[1][2] INCONTROLLER can modified program logic on Omron PLCs using either the program download or backup transfer functions available through the HTTP server.[1] \n\n\n\n\n S1006 \n\n\n PLC-Blaster \n\n\nPLC-Blaster utilizes the PLC communication and management API to load executable Program Organization Units.

Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.   Methods of Manipulation of Control include: Man-in-the-middle  Spoof command message Changing setpoints  A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland. [1] [2] [3] Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops. [2] The track controlling commands issued may have also resulted in tram collisions, a further risk to those on board and nearby the areas of impact.

Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system's API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0888\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nDiscovery \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa013 April 2021\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea payload gathers server information that includes CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.

It then searches the logical nodes for the CSW value, which indicates the device performs a circuit breaker or switch control function.[5]Industroyer's OPC DA module also uses IOPCBrowseServerAddressSpace to look for items with the following strings: ctlSelOn, ctlOperOn, ctlSelOff, ctlOperOff, Pos and stVal.[5]Industroyer IEC 60870-5-104 module includes a range mode to discover Information Object Addresses (IOAs) by enumerating through each.[5]\n\n\n\n\n S1072 \n\n\n Industroyer2 \n\n\nIndustroyer2 has the capability to poll a target device about its connection status, data transfer status, Common Address (CA), Information Object Addresses (IOAs), and IO state values across multiple priority levels.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n S0603 \n\n\n Stuxnet \n\n\nStuxnet enumerates and parses the System Data Blocks (SDB) using the s7blk_findfirst and s7blk_findnext API calls in s7otbxdx.dll. Stuxnet must find an SDB with the DWORD at offset 50h equal to 0100CB2Ch. This specifies that the system uses the Profibus communications processor module CP 342-5. In addition, specific values are searched for and counted: 7050h and 9500h. 7050h is assigned to part number KFC750V3 which appears to be a frequency converter drive (also known as variable frequency drive) manufactured by Fararo Paya in Teheran, Iran. 9500h is assigned to Vacon NX frequency converter drives manufactured by Vacon based in Finland.[8]Stuxnet was specifically targeting CPUs 6ES7-315-2 (Series 300) with special system data block characteristics for sequence A or B and 6ES7-315-2 for sequence C. The PLC type can also be checked using the s7ag_read_szl API.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeted Assets\n\n\n\nID\nAsset\n\n\n\n\n\n A0008 \n\n\n Application Server \n\n\n\n\n A0007 \n\n\n Control Server \n\n\n\n\n A0009 \n\n\n Data Gateway \n\n\n\n\n A0006 \n\n\n Data Historian \n\n\n\n\n A0013 \n\n\n Field I/O \n\n\n\n\n A0002 \n\n\n Human-Machine Interface (HMI) \n\n\n\n\n A0005 \n\n\n Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) \n\n\n\n\n A0012 \n\n\n Jump Host \n\n\n\n\n A0003 \n\n\n Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) \n\n\n\n\n A0004 \n\n\n Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)"", metadata={'source': 'https://attack.mitre.org//techniques/T0888', 'title': 'Remote System Information Discovery, Technique T0888 - ICS | MITRE ATT&CK®', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='A0005 \n\n\n Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) \n\n\n\n\n A0012 \n\n\n Jump Host \n\n\n\n\n A0003 \n\n\n Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) \n\n\n\n\n A0004 \n\n\n Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) \n\n\n\n\n A0010 \n\n\n Safety Controller \n\n\n\n\n A0011 \n\n\n Virtual Private Network (VPN) Server \n\n\n\n\n A0001 \n\n\n Workstation \n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\n\n\n\nID\nMitigation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n M0814 \n\n\n Static Network Configuration \n\n\nICS environments typically have more statically defined devices, therefore minimize the use of both IT discovery protocols (e.g., DHCP, LLDP) and discovery functions in automation protocols.

In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. Reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system or identifying important events such as deviations from expected values. If an adversary has the ability to Spoof Reporting Messages, they can impact the control system in many ways. The adversary can Spoof Reporting Messages that state that the process is operating normally, as a form of evasion. The adversary could also Spoof Reporting Messages to make the defenders and operators think that other errors are occurring in order to distract them from the actual source of a problem.

A rogue master can be used to send legitimate control messages to other control system devices, affecting processes in unintended ways. It may also be used to disrupt network communications by capturing and receiving the network traffic meant for the actual master. Impersonating a master may also allow an adversary to avoid detection. In the case of the 2017 Dallas Siren incident, adversaries used a rogue master to send command messages to the 156 distributed sirens across the city, either through a single rogue transmitter with a strong signal, or using many distributed repeaters.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

These services allow users to connect to internal network resources from external locations. Examples are VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms. Remote service gateways often manage connections and credential authentication for these services. [1]External remote services allow administration of a control system from outside the system. Often, vendors and internal engineering groups have access to external remote services to control system networks via the corporate network. In some cases, this access is enabled directly from the internet. While remote access enables ease of maintenance when a control system is in a remote area, compromise of remote access solutions is a liability. The adversary may use these services to gain access to and execute attacks against a control system network. Access to valid accounts is often a requirement. As they look for an entry point into the control system network, adversaries may begin searching for existing point-to-point VPN implementations at trusted third party networks or through remote support employee connections where split tunneling is enabled.

In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way. Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence. [1] The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0859\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactics:\nPersistence,                                                        Lateral Movement \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n C0028 \n\n\n 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack \n\n\nDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used valid accounts to laterally move through VPN connections and dual-homed systems.

These services allow users to connect to internal network resources from external locations. Examples are VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms. Remote service gateways often manage connections and credential authentication for these services. [1]External remote services allow administration of a control system from outside the system. Often, vendors and internal engineering groups have access to external remote services to control system networks via the corporate network. In some cases, this access is enabled directly from the internet. While remote access enables ease of maintenance when a control system is in a remote area, compromise of remote access solutions is a liability. The adversary may use these services to gain access to and execute attacks against a control system network. Access to valid accounts is often a requirement. As they look for an entry point into the control system network, adversaries may begin searching for existing point-to-point VPN implementations at trusted third party networks or through remote support employee connections where split tunneling is enabled.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors. [1] Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets. The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations. Initial access to the intended targets used watering hole attacks to target process control, ICS, and critical infrastructure related trade publications and informational websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0817\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n G1000 \n\n\n ALLANITE \n\n\nALLANITE leverages watering hole attacks to gain access into electric utilities.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

These services allow users to connect to internal network resources from external locations. Examples are VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms. Remote service gateways often manage connections and credential authentication for these services. [1]External remote services allow administration of a control system from outside the system. Often, vendors and internal engineering groups have access to external remote services to control system networks via the corporate network. In some cases, this access is enabled directly from the internet. While remote access enables ease of maintenance when a control system is in a remote area, compromise of remote access solutions is a liability. The adversary may use these services to gain access to and execute attacks against a control system network. Access to valid accounts is often a requirement. As they look for an entry point into the control system network, adversaries may begin searching for existing point-to-point VPN implementations at trusted third party networks or through remote support employee connections where split tunneling is enabled.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution and access. [1] A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees. The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.

With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website. The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website. This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors. [1] Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets. The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations. Initial access to the intended targets used watering hole attacks to target process control, ICS, and critical infrastructure related trade publications and informational websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0817\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.0\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n G1000 \n\n\n ALLANITE \n\n\nALLANITE leverages watering hole attacks to gain access into electric utilities.

These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms. [1] [2] [3] Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions. Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations. An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed [1] to multiple network segments, and can be used for Program Download or to execute attacks on control devices directly through Valid Accounts.Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable Graphical User Interface execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.

Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment. Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms. This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites. Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience. In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.   Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators. These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards. Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk. [1] Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo. The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product. [1] F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. [2] The adversary planted trojanized software installers available on legitimate ICS/SCADA vendor websites. After being downloaded, this software infected the host computer with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID:\xa0T0862\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nSub-techniques:\xa0\n                                                        No sub-techniques\n                                            \n\n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nTactic:\nInitial Access \n\n\n\nⓘ\n\n\nPlatforms:\xa0None\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nVersion:\xa01.1\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nCreated:\xa021 May 2020\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nLast Modified:\xa013 October 2023\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Permalink\n\n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\nProcedure Examples\n\n\n\n\nID\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n S0093 \n\n\n Backdoor.Oldrea \n\n\nThe Backdoor.Oldrea RAT is distributed through trojanized installers planted on compromised vendor sites.

In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. Reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system or identifying important events such as deviations from expected values. If an adversary has the ability to Spoof Reporting Messages, they can impact the control system in many ways. The adversary can Spoof Reporting Messages that state that the process is operating normally, as a form of evasion. The adversary could also Spoof Reporting Messages to make the defenders and operators think that other errors are occurring in order to distract them from the actual source of a problem.

If not, utilize bump-in-the-wire devices or VPNs to enforce communication authenticity between devices that are not capable of supporting this (e.g., legacy controllers, RTUs).\n\n\n\n\n M0937 \n\n\n Filter Network Traffic \n\n\nPerform inline allowlisting of automation protocol commands  to prevent devices from sending unauthorized command or reporting messages. Allow/denylist techniques need to be designed with sufficient accuracy to prevent the unintended blocking of valid messages.\n\n\n\n\n M0807 \n\n\n Network Allowlists \n\n\nUse host-based allowlists to prevent devices from accepting connections from unauthorized systems. For example, allowlists can be used to ensure devices can only connect with master stations or known management/engineering workstations.
